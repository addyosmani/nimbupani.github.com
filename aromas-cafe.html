<div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I had breakfast with <a href="http://deepak.jois.name/">Deepak</a> at this place called Aromas Cafe (forgot the exact name). First I have to tell you about the location before I go ga-ga over the cafe itself.</p>

<p>Craig Road is one of those streets that have been &#8220;preseved&#8221; in their colonial forms. This means, all you can see in that street are shop houses (though capitalism has taken over and destroyed several of them to build a spanking new condo). And this is no mean street mind you, there are these &#8220;massage parlours&#8221; which mysteriously are open only in the night (they appear more mysterious with the pictures of topless men and women in their banners), small art galleries, law firms, interior decorators, real estate offices, and the works.</p>

<p>Craig Road is very unique because of two shops. It has an antique shop and <a href="http://www.aromas.com.sg/boutique_cafes.htm">a cafe</a>. I consider this antique shop tops the list of the best places to window shop. I have been much of an antique worm  even before I knew the meaning of the word. I love antiques. Even papers, soap boxes, coins, chains, chairs, magazines and the works. And in Chennai, my favourite haunts were the old newspaper shops where you sell your old newspapers and get some measley coins in exchange. And this shop on Craig Road has the EXACT same feeling. Except it is populated by wooden furniture.</p>

<p>The guy who mans the shop is a sharp, witty old fella. He apparently sources antiques for others. And the interior decorators I got to know there, say he is very good at sourcing antique furniture for their designs.</p>

<p>The shop is magical. I was entranced by every item he has. The best was the broken gramophone. I havent seen one in my life and my spirits soared to see one! Anyways, it is the shop to go to if you love nostalgia and the British Raj relics.</p>

<p>The second uniqueness of Craig Road is this cafe. Its name begins with &#8220;Aroma&#8221; and I was too fascinated by the ambience to even bother knowing the full name. And yes, it was GREAT. And if the antique shop was the godown, the cafe was the palace.</p>

<p>The cafe is in colonial style, replete with the antique furniture. They werent any fake antiques but REAL ONES. This, of course, melts my heart and would have gladly parted with my life savings, if they had just asked. The best part were the fans. Sighhhhhhhhhh&#8230;why dont they make such fans these days!</p>

<p>Not to mention, the breakfast was delicious. Never before I had such heavenly scrambled eggs. Never sat in such antique, unique chairs before. Felt like a colonial enjoying a quiet British breakfast.</p>

<p>Pictures will be up once I save enough to buy a good camera for such use or pester <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/vmulky/">vrush</a> to wield her lens on such items of beauty!</p>
