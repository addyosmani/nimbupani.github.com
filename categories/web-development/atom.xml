    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early 2000s, when the web was in its infancy, a great number of committed activists made Open Web Standards possible. They advocated, wrote the specifications, explained them to the masses, and contributed to the revolution of using W3C Specs on the web. I owe each of them my career as a Web Designer/developer.</p>




<p>Now, we are in the middle of another revolution. The web as we know it is changing significantly. The ways of doing, implementing and working with web pages have altered. Designing with the right semantic tags or using floats instead of tables are no longer the simple goals of a good web page. We need the pages to load quickly, use the faster newer CSS selectors and DOM APIs, and better ways to create animations, dynamic images, and dealing with how to design for a variety of devices that now have browsers. </p>




<p>The best way to be a part of the revolution is to BE the revolution, not talk ABOUT the revolution. A lot of recognized individuals seem to be doing the latter. To BE the revolution, you just need to look at what some of the people at the fore-front of it are doing: <a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> and <a href="http://farukat.es/">Faruk Ateş</a> have made the future accessible with <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a>. <a href="http://peter.sh/">Peter Beverloo</a> created the <a href="http://peter.sh/category/last-week/">"Last Week in…"</a> series that has been re-adopted by <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/archive/open_web/">W3C</a> and <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/category/weekly-review">WHATWG</a> where you can keep up with the pace of creation and implementation of web specifications. <a href="http://www.scottjehl.com/">Scott Jehl</a> created <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Respond.js</a> which lets older browsers understand media queries, <a href="http://www.blog.highub.com/">Shi Chuan</a> made designing for multiple devices easy by exhaustive research for <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/">HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate</a>. Jon Neal made practical use of HTML5 elements easy with <a href="http://www.iecss.com/print-protector/">IE Print Protector</a>. <a href="http://leaverou.me/">Lea Verou</a> has been <a href="http://leaverou.me/2010/07/organizing-a-university-course-on-modern-web-development/">teaching web development</a> and is the author of significant articles on web development. <a href="http://www.accessibleculture.org/">Jason Kiss</a> has been documenting how <a href="http://www.accessibleculture.org/research/html5-aria-2011/">HTML5 elements, ARIA work with different Screen readers</a> without much fanfare. <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/">Nicolas Gallagher</a>, <a href="http://www.thecssninja.com/">Ryan Seddon</a>, <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/">Mathias Bynens</a> and several others have been doing similar practical investigations on how to use what’s new and awesome in real life scenarios.</p>


<p></p>

<p>But these are not the people who are known revolutionaries. Unfortunately, the people who seem to be recognized for pushing the envelope are people who talk ABOUT the change, those who split hairs on whether to call something "Responsive" or "Adaptive" or speak about HTML5/CSS3 but have very little code to show for their understanding of it. </p>




<p>Now is the time to get developers on board the new rush of web standards, not to promote litigation on the presence or absence of a single HTML attribute, or debate a merits of the name of a technique. What it does is to deflect attention from learning, instead directs developers to spend more time beating about the bush and not be fully engaged in what’s coming.</p>




<p>It is time to move on. I acknowledge all these past trail blazers, but they are not at the forefront today. Following their advocacy does not shed light on all the practical implementations that are possible while exploring new technology. People seem to know - but not use - the latest in web standards, and several are on the fence because they do not know how to work with new standards right now. </p>




<p>It is time for us to get new idols. Here is what my idols do:</p>




<h3>Create</h3>


<p>They code. They have demos on their website or on Github.</p>




<p>They write. They write tutorials that are not browser-specific, and link back to specifications, have comments and update their posts with newer/better ideas from within the comments section.</p>




<h3>Research</h3>


<p></p>

<p>They research and publish their findings. A lot of recommended practices are dogma and hearsay - creating practical examples to test such assertions and validate them would be cornerstone of their work.</p>




<p>They know what is new. Web standards keep changing. They should know what is new, what is relevant and what shouldn't be promoted. They talk and respond to your queries and are not too busy to find time to write code that works.</p>




<h3>Collaborate</h3>


<p>They do not work in isolation, but get people together who can create projects that benefit the web.[Bonus!] They are available on mailing-lists, forums, or IRC channels to help n00bs when they can.</p>




<p>If you think it is hard to find these people, then you are not looking. All the people I mentioned earlier are people worthy of listening to. Look at who else they are talking to, or doing projects with, follow the trail. </p>




<p>The old revolution is dead, long live the revolution.</p>

    <updated>2011-05-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nimbupani.github.com/blog/some-css-transition-hacks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am speaking at <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org/program/design#creative-css3">some</a> <a href="http://2011.texasjavascript.com/">events</a> which means I have to write a few demos. You can find some <a href="http://nimbu.in/unplugged/demos/">here</a>, and I am in the process of creating more. While doing so, I have come across two new (to me), ways of applying transitions.  This only works for the conditions stated here, and you should think carefully before trying to expand these to be used elsewhere.</p>




<h2>Fake Transitions on Gradients</h2>


<p>As you know, no browser supports transitions in CSS gradients (yet). But, we have two tools to fake this: transitions that work on background colors, and multiple backgrounds. Given transitions can interpolate colors, we simply transition the background color and apply a gradient image on top of it which fades to transparent value (giving the illusion of an transitioning gradient). </p>


<p>Here is a demo:</p>


<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/zuNbj/embedded/result,css"></iframe>


<h3>Caveat</h3>


<ul><li>This works great on simple gradients. You probably do not want to use this with multiple backgrounds as it would be a terrible pain to manage the right backgrounds to change.</li></ul>




<h2>Animate elements with just font-size</h2>


<p>Transitions can be applied on CSS transforms, so if you wish to scale an element on hover, it would be a matter of applying the right prefixed transition on the right prefixed transform and writing the vendor-prefixed scale transform 5 times on hover.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I am lazy, and I like to avoid typing if I can. So, given we can use <code>em</code> as a unit for width, height, line-height and border-radius would be something we can take advantage of. What this unit means is each of these properties are now relative to the <code>font-size</code> we set on the element.</p>


<p>Now all we need to do is transition the font-size, and we get bonus transitions on width, height, line-height and border-radius! Now you can be carefully choose which elements should use em units depending on which properties (that use em unit values) you want transitioned.</p>


<p>Don't be so quick to gloat though. Webkit does not transition width, height, line-height if you only transition the font-size, so you would need to set <code>-webkit-transition: all 1s;</code> to get it to work on webkit.</p>




<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/86kET/embedded/result,css"></iframe>


<h3>Caveats</h3>


<ul>
<li>The element expands in area - unlike a scale transform which expands without nudging other elements out of the way. This means elements adjacent to this element will move unless they are all positioned absolutely. You can also position the element to which transition is being applied absolutely so as to not impact rest of them.</li>
<li>This only works for properties you want to transform that accept length units. </li>
<li>If you do not want the text within the transformed element to also transform, using this method would be easier. When using transforms, you would need to reset the transform on the wrapper around the text so as to prevent text from transforming. In the above demo, the blue disc has considerably more rules and declarations to prevent scaling of text as compared to transforming the font size.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you know of a snappier way to do these, please fork the fiddles and link to your forks in the comments.</p>

    <link href="http://nimbupani.github.com/blog/safe-css-defaults.html"/>
    <updated>2011-04-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nimbupani.github.com/blog/safe-css-defaults</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know those nights when you race towards a deadline, banging out the CSS as fast as you can, there comes a moment when you pause…wondering what keyword would get rid of that z-index on that anchor, then you make the best guess you can, and type:</p>




<pre><code>z-index: none;</code></pre>




<p>Then go on in life, as it “renders” like you wanted it, it works, no big deal. </p>




<p>But it is. Specifying incorrect values might inject behaviour that you did not expect. It is quite possible that the currently incorrect value might be, in the future, used for a valid value which would distort the design you so carefully did (and how often do we revisit a client’s website to update? :).</p>




<h3>Initial Values</h3>


<p>The spec defines a value that will be the <em>initial</em> value for a property when it is not declared in any stylesheets - either the user agent stylesheet (look at <a href="http://www.iecss.com/">iecss.com</a> for stylesheets of IE, <a href="http://www.iecss.com/opera-10.51.css">Opera</a>, <a href="http://www.iecss.com/firefox-3.6.3.css">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.iecss.com/webkit-r61376.css">Webkit</a>) or the ones you write.</p>




<p>Now, user agents assign values to CSS properties too. For example, when you do not declare margins on <code>h1</code>, the user agents have an initial value for margins. IE sets this to be <code>14pt</code>, Firefox, Opera sets this to <code>0.67em</code>, etc. This is not defined by the specifications and there is no keyword to obtain the values set by user agents.</p>




<p>Initial values are different from inherited values. All properties accept a keyword <code>inherit</code>. When you use the keyword <code>inherit</code> on a property, the browser applies the value that it finds on its parent element. On <code>html</code> element if you use the value <code>inherit</code>, it applies the initial value. </p>




<h3>Good News!</h3>


<p><a href="http://leaverou.me">Lea Verou</a> alerted me to the CSS3 keyword <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#keywords"><code>initial</code> which will set the CSS3 property to the initial value as defined in the spec</a>. Sadly, the only browsers that supports this seems to be <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/CgRAZ/10/show/">Firefox</a> (with a <code>-moz-</code> prefix) and Webkit's Safari and Chrome (yay!).</p>




<p>So until full support lands on all browsers for this amazing keyword and we don't have to support browsers that do not recognize that keyword, here are some of the ways you can reset some CSS properties to their initial values:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave my first ever big talk at <a href="http://south10.webdirections.org/program/w3c#active-web-development">Web Directions South in Sydney</a> last year. This May, I will be speaking at <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org">Unplugged</a> in Seattle!</p>

<p>It is going to be a different talk this time, — less on the activism and more on <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org/program/design/#creative-css3">maximizing the cool on your web app styles</a>.</p>

<p>As a front-end firefighter, I have learnt about the pain of working with a team, each with their own style and philosophy on what constitutes good markup, style, and script. While working on <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> (and the website), a different layer of complexity showed up - managing styles/markup for different languages, choosing what to add or remove from the templates that have become the default choice of several front-end developers.</p>

<p>Unplugged is where I hope to share some of the lessons learned and how to push the boundaries with browsers that can, while providing what can be managed best on browsers that can't and introduce some tools to make your front-end development far more easier.</p>

<p>The event is on <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org/program/">12-13th May in The Conference Center</a>. Knowing the Web Directions folks, I know it would be a super smooth and well organized event, so you should be there. There is even a discount code - <em>WDMANIAN</em> - you can use to take $50 off the regular price.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<h3>Design of the Bokeh</h3>


<p>I referred to some pictures of bokeh, and these were their defining characteristics:</p>


<ul>
  <li>There should be groups of circles with same color (each circle outlined with the more opaque version of the fill). In each group, circles are close to each other.</li>
  <li>The color transition from one color group to the other can be accomplished with a very blurry second color group radial gradient overlaid on the first group.</li>
  <li>Each color group needs to have a very blurry large background circle to base the rest of the circles from.</li>
  <li>Each color group has 2 or more of smaller circles and one big blurry circle as a base.</li>
  <li>Colors used are almost transparent so that the background color shows through, and the colors mix well when they are overlaid.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Implementation</h3>


<p>Here is how a single "tile" looks like:</p>




<p><img src="http://nimbupani.com/files/bokeh-graph.png" alt="bokeh-graph.png" border="0" width="420" height="300"></p>




<p>The black background is the size of the "tile", set by <code>background-size</code> property (the grey area is where our circles spill over). In our demo it is 300px square. Each of these circles is a background image (all gradients are background images), and have a default <code>background-size</code> property set to the top left corner of the tile, which means, the center of each of the circle is at the intersection of the yellow lines in the image above.</p>




<p>Then, we use <code>background-position</code> to offset them into places we want.</p>


<p>By tweaking the <code>background-position</code> for each of the gradient images, we also move the center of each of the circle - shown in the image above relatively. Do note that what <em>actually</em> moves is the top left corner, but I find it easier to visualize the positioning of radial gradients in this manner.</p>




<p>By using <code>background-repeat</code>, we can repeat our bokeh across the screen! You can tweak the tile size so you can get some interesting effects.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Needless to say, this demo <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gradients">only works</a> on Firefox 3.6+, Safari 4+, Chrome 10+ all of which support CSS3 radial gradients as it has been finalized in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/#radial-gradients">spec</a> (support is coming soon in Opera 11).</p>




<h3>Update</h3>


<p><a href="http://a.deveria.com/">Alexis</a> has kindly <a href="http://nimbupani.com/bokeh-with-css3-gradients.html#comment-3620">provided an SVG</a> that would work as well for browsers that do not support gradients! I have updated the demo to use <a href="http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/2.0-beta/#cssgradients">Modernizr</a> to detect for gradients, and serve the SVG version if the browser does not support it. Whee! Thanks Alexis!</p>
