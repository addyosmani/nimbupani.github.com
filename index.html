  <div class="entry-content"><p>In early 2000s, when the web was in its infancy, a great number of committed activists made Open Web Standards possible. They advocated, wrote the specifications, explained them to the masses, and contributed to the revolution of using W3C Specs on the web. I owe each of them my career as a Web Designer/developer.</p>




<p>Now, we are in the middle of another revolution. The web as we know it is changing significantly. The ways of doing, implementing and working with web pages have altered. Designing with the right semantic tags or using floats instead of tables are no longer the simple goals of a good web page. We need the pages to load quickly, use the faster newer CSS selectors and DOM APIs, and better ways to create animations, dynamic images, and dealing with how to design for a variety of devices that now have browsers. </p>




<p>The best way to be a part of the revolution is to BE the revolution, not talk ABOUT the revolution. A lot of recognized individuals seem to be doing the latter. To BE the revolution, you just need to look at what some of the people at the fore-front of it are doing: <a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> and <a href="http://farukat.es/">Faruk Ateş</a> have made the future accessible with <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a>. <a href="http://peter.sh/">Peter Beverloo</a> created the <a href="http://peter.sh/category/last-week/">&#8220;Last Week in…&#8221;</a> series that has been re-adopted by <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/archive/open_web/">W3C</a> and <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/category/weekly-review">WHATWG</a> where you can keep up with the pace of creation and implementation of web specifications. <a href="http://www.scottjehl.com/">Scott Jehl</a> created <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Respond.js</a> which lets older browsers understand media queries, <a href="http://www.blog.highub.com/">Shi Chuan</a> made designing for multiple devices easy by exhaustive research for <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/">HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate</a>. Jon Neal made practical use of HTML5 elements easy with <a href="http://www.iecss.com/print-protector/">IE Print Protector</a>. <a href="http://leaverou.me/">Lea Verou</a> has been <a href="http://leaverou.me/2010/07/organizing-a-university-course-on-modern-web-development/">teaching web development</a> and is the author of significant articles on web development. <a href="http://www.accessibleculture.org/">Jason Kiss</a> has been documenting how <a href="http://www.accessibleculture.org/research/html5-aria-2011/">HTML5 elements, ARIA work with different Screen readers</a> without much fanfare. <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/">Nicolas Gallagher</a>, <a href="http://www.thecssninja.com/">Ryan Seddon</a>, <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/">Mathias Bynens</a> and several others have been doing similar practical investigations on how to use what’s new and awesome in real life scenarios.</p>


<p></p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;But these are not the people who are known revolutionaries. Unfortunately, the people who seem to be recognized for pushing the envelope are people who talk ABOUT the change, those who split hairs on whether to call something "Responsive" or "Adaptive" or speak about HTML5/CSS3 but have very little code to show for their understanding of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to get developers on board the new rush of web standards, not to promote litigation on the presence or absence of a single HTML attribute, or debate a merits of the name of a technique. What it does is to deflect attention from learning, instead directs developers to spend more time beating about the bush and not be fully engaged in what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time to move on. I acknowledge all these past trail blazers, but they are not at the forefront today. Following their advocacy does not shed light on all the practical implementations that are possible while exploring new technology. People seem to know - but not use - the latest in web standards, and several are on the fence because they do not know how to work with new standards right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time for us to get new idols. Here is what my idols do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Create&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They code. They have demos on their website or on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They write. They write tutorials that are not browser-specific, and link back to specifications, have comments and update their posts with newer/better ideas from within the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;They research and publish their findings. A lot of recommended practices are dogma and hearsay - creating practical examples to test such assertions and validate them would be cornerstone of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They know what is new. Web standards keep changing. They should know what is new, what is relevant and what shouldn't be promoted. They talk and respond to your queries and are not too busy to find time to write code that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Collaborate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do not work in isolation, but get people together who can create projects that benefit the web.[Bonus!] They are available on mailing-lists, forums, or IRC channels to help n00bs when they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think it is hard to find these people, then you are not looking. All the people I mentioned earlier are people worthy of listening to. Look at who else they are talking to, or doing projects with, follow the trail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old revolution is dead, long live the revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am speaking at <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org/program/design#creative-css3">some</a> <a href="http://2011.texasjavascript.com/">events</a> which means I have to write a few demos. You can find some <a href="http://nimbu.in/unplugged/demos/">here</a>, and I am in the process of creating more. While doing so, I have come across two new (to me), ways of applying transitions.  This only works for the conditions stated here, and you should think carefully before trying to expand these to be used elsewhere.</p>




<h2>Fake Transitions on Gradients</h2>


<p>As you know, no browser supports transitions in CSS gradients (yet). But, we have two tools to fake this: transitions that work on background colors, and multiple backgrounds. Given transitions can interpolate colors, we simply transition the background color and apply a gradient image on top of it which fades to transparent value (giving the illusion of an transitioning gradient). </p>


<p>Here is a demo:</p>


<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/zuNbj/embedded/result,css"></iframe>


<h3>Caveat</h3>


<ul><li>This works great on simple gradients. You probably do not want to use this with multiple backgrounds as it would be a terrible pain to manage the right backgrounds to change.</li></ul>




<h2>Animate elements with just font-size</h2>


<p>Transitions can be applied on CSS transforms, so if you wish to scale an element on hover, it would be a matter of applying the right prefixed transition on the right prefixed transform and writing the vendor-prefixed scale transform 5 times on hover.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I am lazy, and I like to avoid typing if I can. So, given we can use <code>em</code> as a unit for width, height, line-height and border-radius would be something we can take advantage of. What this unit means is each of these properties are now relative to the <code>font-size</code> we set on the element.</p>


<p>Now all we need to do is transition the font-size, and we get bonus transitions on width, height, line-height and border-radius! Now you can be carefully choose which elements should use em units depending on which properties (that use em unit values) you want transitioned.</p>


<p>Don&#8217;t be so quick to gloat though. Webkit does not transition width, height, line-height if you only transition the font-size, so you would need to set <code>-webkit-transition: all 1s;</code> to get it to work on webkit.</p>




<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/86kET/embedded/result,css"></iframe>


<h3>Caveats</h3>


<ul>
<li>The element expands in area - unlike a scale transform which expands without nudging other elements out of the way. This means elements adjacent to this element will move unless they are all positioned absolutely. You can also position the element to which transition is being applied absolutely so as to not impact rest of them.</li>
<li>This only works for properties you want to transform that accept length units. </li>
<li>If you do not want the text within the transformed element to also transform, using this method would be easier. When using transforms, you would need to reset the transform on the wrapper around the text so as to prevent text from transforming. In the above demo, the blue disc has considerably more rules and declarations to prevent scaling of text as compared to transforming the font size.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you know of a snappier way to do these, please fork the fiddles and link to your forks in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know those nights when you race towards a deadline, banging out the CSS as fast as you can, there comes a moment when you pause…wondering what keyword would get rid of that z-index on that anchor, then you make the best guess you can, and type:</p>




<pre><code>z-index: none;</code></pre>




<p>Then go on in life, as it “renders” like you wanted it, it works, no big deal. </p>




<p>But it is. Specifying incorrect values might inject behaviour that you did not expect. It is quite possible that the currently incorrect value might be, in the future, used for a valid value which would distort the design you so carefully did (and how often do we revisit a client’s website to update? :).</p>




<h3>Initial Values</h3>


<p>The spec defines a value that will be the <em>initial</em> value for a property when it is not declared in any stylesheets - either the user agent stylesheet (look at <a href="http://www.iecss.com/">iecss.com</a> for stylesheets of IE, <a href="http://www.iecss.com/opera-10.51.css">Opera</a>, <a href="http://www.iecss.com/firefox-3.6.3.css">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.iecss.com/webkit-r61376.css">Webkit</a>) or the ones you write.</p>




<p>Now, user agents assign values to CSS properties too. For example, when you do not declare margins on <code>h1</code>, the user agents have an initial value for margins. IE sets this to be <code>14pt</code>, Firefox, Opera sets this to <code>0.67em</code>, etc. This is not defined by the specifications and there is no keyword to obtain the values set by user agents.</p>




<p>Initial values are different from inherited values. All properties accept a keyword <code>inherit</code>. When you use the keyword <code>inherit</code> on a property, the browser applies the value that it finds on its parent element. On <code>html</code> element if you use the value <code>inherit</code>, it applies the initial value. </p>




<h3>Good News!</h3>


<p><a href="http://leaverou.me">Lea Verou</a> alerted me to the CSS3 keyword <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#keywords"><code>initial</code> which will set the CSS3 property to the initial value as defined in the spec</a>. Sadly, the only browsers that supports this seems to be <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/CgRAZ/10/show/">Firefox</a> (with a <code>-moz-</code> prefix) and Webkit&#8217;s Safari and Chrome (yay!).</p>




<p>So until full support lands on all browsers for this amazing keyword and we don&#8217;t have to support browsers that do not recognize that keyword, here are some of the ways you can reset some CSS properties to their initial values:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave my first ever big talk at <a href="http://south10.webdirections.org/program/w3c#active-web-development">Web Directions South in Sydney</a> last year. This May, I will be speaking at <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org">Unplugged</a> in Seattle!</p>

<p>It is going to be a different talk this time, — less on the activism and more on <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org/program/design/#creative-css3">maximizing the cool on your web app styles</a>.</p>

<p>As a front-end firefighter, I have learnt about the pain of working with a team, each with their own style and philosophy on what constitutes good markup, style, and script. While working on <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> (and the website), a different layer of complexity showed up - managing styles/markup for different languages, choosing what to add or remove from the templates that have become the default choice of several front-end developers.</p>

<p>Unplugged is where I hope to share some of the lessons learned and how to push the boundaries with browsers that can, while providing what can be managed best on browsers that can&#8217;t and introduce some tools to make your front-end development far more easier.</p>

<p>The event is on <a href="http://unplugged11.webdirections.org/program/">12-13th May in The Conference Center</a>. Knowing the Web Directions folks, I know it would be a super smooth and well organized event, so you should be there. There is even a discount code - <em>WDMANIAN</em> - you can use to take $50 off the regular price.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since <a href="http://leaverou.me/2010/12/checkered-stripes-other-background-patterns-with-css3-gradients/">Lea Verou mentioned about the possibilities of CSS3 Gradients</a>, I have been using them in various shapes and sizes as a replacement for background images. I recently worked on a project which uses a bunch of circles as a decorative background. <a href="http://gf3.ca/">gf3</a> suggested that the circles would look much better like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a>. Today, I finally got down to creating them.</p>




<h3>Result</h3>


<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/CPCRU/embedded/result,css"></iframe>




<h3>Design of the Bokeh</h3>


<p>I referred to some pictures of bokeh, and these were their defining characteristics:</p>


<ul>
  <li>There should be groups of circles with same color (each circle outlined with the more opaque version of the fill). In each group, circles are close to each other.</li>
  <li>The color transition from one color group to the other can be accomplished with a very blurry second color group radial gradient overlaid on the first group.</li>
  <li>Each color group needs to have a very blurry large background circle to base the rest of the circles from.</li>
  <li>Each color group has 2 or more of smaller circles and one big blurry circle as a base.</li>
  <li>Colors used are almost transparent so that the background color shows through, and the colors mix well when they are overlaid.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Implementation</h3>


<p>Here is how a single &#8220;tile&#8221; looks like:</p>




<p><img src="http://nimbupani.com/files/bokeh-graph.png" alt="bokeh-graph.png" border="0" width="420" height="300"></p>




<p>The black background is the size of the &#8220;tile&#8221;, set by <code>background-size</code> property (the grey area is where our circles spill over). In our demo it is 300px square. Each of these circles is a background image (all gradients are background images), and have a default <code>background-size</code> property set to the top left corner of the tile, which means, the center of each of the circle is at the intersection of the yellow lines in the image above.</p>




<p>Then, we use <code>background-position</code> to offset them into places we want.</p>


<p>By tweaking the <code>background-position</code> for each of the gradient images, we also move the center of each of the circle - shown in the image above relatively. Do note that what <em>actually</em> moves is the top left corner, but I find it easier to visualize the positioning of radial gradients in this manner.</p>




<p>By using <code>background-repeat</code>, we can repeat our bokeh across the screen! You can tweak the tile size so you can get some interesting effects.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Needless to say, this demo <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gradients">only works</a> on Firefox 3.6+, Safari 4+, Chrome 10+ all of which support CSS3 radial gradients as it has been finalized in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/#radial-gradients">spec</a> (support is coming soon in Opera 11).</p>




<h3>Update</h3>


<p><a href="http://a.deveria.com/">Alexis</a> has kindly <a href="http://nimbupani.com/bokeh-with-css3-gradients.html#comment-3620">provided an SVG</a> that would work as well for browsers that do not support gradients! I have updated the demo to use <a href="http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/2.0-beta/#cssgradients">Modernizr</a> to detect for gradients, and serve the SVG version if the browser does not support it. Whee! Thanks Alexis!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I appreciate the effort that goes into creating a pure CSS3/HTML5 demo, but unfortunately many beginners consider these demos as representation of the best practices in Web Development (many aren&#8217;t). Here is one that got my goat today: A <a href="http://designmadeingermany.de/slideshow/">Pure CSS3 Slideshow</a>.</p>




<p>Here are some reasons why this is not a great example of best practices:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Uses a table for navigation when the semantic nav element (or a simple list) would do.</li>
  <li>Implements features using <code>-moz</code>, <code>-webkit</code> only prefix. Why not add the standard that they are temporary demonstrations for (and while at it, also support <a href="http://opera.com">other</a> <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/">browsers</a>?)</li>
  <li><p>This is how it degrades on browsers that do not support CSS3 transitions, and transforms:</p>
    <p><img src="http://nimbupani.com/files/79e91b32f7713c3a03a5650e476ade27.png" alt="79e91b32f7713c3a03a5650e476ade27.png" border="0" width="600" height="348" /></p>    
  </li>
</ul>


<p>So, lets fix it! Here is the final result:</p>


<p></p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/KEqSF/embedded/result,html,css"></iframe>


<h3>Changes:</h3>


<ul>
<li><p>No translateX functions. All we need to do is to animate the <code>left</code> property. So:</p>
<pre><code>#a1:target .page { -webkit-transform: translateX(-100%); -moz-transform: translateX(-100%); }
#a2:target .page { -webkit-transform: translateX(-200%); -moz-transform: translateX(-200%); }
#a3:target .page { -webkit-transform: translateX(-300%); -moz-transform: translateX(-300%); }</code></pre>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code>#a1:target .pages { left: 0%; }
#a2:target .pages { left: -100%; }
#a3:target .pages { left: -200%; }</code></pre>
</li>  
<li>
  I added a parent <code>div</code> element for all the pages so we just need to animate that element and not each of the 3 page elements.  
</li>
<li><p>No tables for nav! Just use the <code>nav</code> element with a set of links:</p>
<pre>
  <code>&lt;table&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a1&quot; id=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a2&quot; id=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a3&quot; id=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>becomes: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the default view, the first page is positioned outside the viewport:</p>  
<pre><code>/* Page Positioning */
#i1 { left: 100%; }
#i2 { left: 200%; }
#i3 { left: 300%; }</code></pre>
<p>This means browsers that do not support transitions effectively see a blank page. We fix this but setting the default position as <code>left: 0</code>, and only adjust the positions for the next 2 slides:</p>
<pre><code>/* Pages */
#i2 { left: 100%; }
#i3 { left: 200%; }  </code></pre>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There, now we have a neat little slideshow, that doesn&#8217;t degrade too badly on browsers that do not support the target element (accessible via the horizontal scrollbar for IE6, 7). If there are ways to improve this, please fork the fiddle and link in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year started pretty well for my reading schedule. I managed to finish two huge books in January, but am on a particularly slow pace since. It also doesn&#8217;t help that I am in Oslo for the first two weeks of Feb getting to know people in Opera as part of my <a href="http://nimbupani.com/web-opener-at-opera.html">new position</a>. So these are all I am left with: </p>




<H3>The Jewel in the Crown</H3>


<p>I was recommended to read this by <a href="http://coldhead.miketaylr.com">Coldhead</a> (warning loud music and visuals). I am usually not a fan of colonialist literature, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226743403?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226743403">The Jewel in the Crown</a> breaks new ground. There are characters of different hues, and the experiences are described vividly, while not portraying a flattering picture of the British Raj. It is very well written and a book (for being so wordy) requires as much to describe the story. I can&#8217;t wait to read the rest of the books in that series.</p>




<h3>Gould&#8217;s Book of Fish</h3>


<p>When I was embarking on my first trip to Australia, good old Coldhead, recommended I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802139590?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802139590">Gould&#8217;s Book of Fish</a> in addition to <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-reviews-for-september.html">Voss</a>. I never got around it, but I finally did! It is incredible (except for the ending). I really cannot describe how amazing it is. I only beg you to read it.</p>




<h3>Tokyo Vice</h3>


<p>This is a horribly written book by someone who was one of the very few white reporters for a Japanese newspaper who worked on the Tokyo police beat. There is an incredible amount of information on how Tokyo&#8217;s police/press work, but it is all suppressed by bad writing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307378799?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307378799">Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan</a> is definitely not worth your time unless you have a passing interest in Tokyo Crime scenes.</p>




<h3>Ender&#8217;s Game</h3>


<p>When I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765342294?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0765342294">Ender&#8217;s Game</a> I thought it was a plot for a bad science fiction movie, but then I realised it was written more than 30 years ago! It is quite a remarkable modern take on alien invasion with more than a thinly veiled support for wars and war games. I suppose the supporters of the book would claim the ending justifies the pacifist motives of the author, but I think it doesn&#8217;t. It is a nice read to escape the tortures of flying, but I don&#8217;t think it does anything more than be a precursor to game strategies outlined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar's_Poker">Liar&#8217;s Poker</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<p>As usual, here is my plea for you to recommend books you liked reading this month!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good news everyone! I am now a Web Opener at <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a>.</p>

<p>I will be writing, breathing Open web standards while also making sure pesky websites that break in Opera no longer do so.  It is a milestone on a journey that started almost two years ago when I started taking web development seriously instead of just another means to an end ($$$).</p>

<p>Needless to say, I will continue working on all the Open Source projects I am involved in (<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://html5readiness.com">HTML5 Readiness</a>, <a href="http://w3fools.com">w3fools</a>, etc) and hopefully more!</p>

<p>I should also mention that, unless I specifically say so, my opinions are solely MINE and not of my employers, just in case you assume otherwise. If you have any questions about Opera, open web standards, do reach me or any of us @<a href="http://twitter.com/ODevRel/">ODevRel</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the interest of documenting useless trivia about CSS3, here is something that I re-discovered thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/ultror">nlogax</a>: <code>currentcolor</code> (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/2ysAr/show/">example</a>).</p>




<p>Borders always render with the current color when a border color is not specified, but, till recently, there was no equivalent term for that use – now we do: <code>currentcolor</code>.</p>




<p>In CSS3, you can use this value to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#currentcolor">indicate you want to use the value of color for other properties</a> that accept a color value: borders, box shadows, outlines, or backgrounds.</p>


<p></p>

<p>This value was <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto23/#css">first supported by Opera in 2009</a>, since then, Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 1+, and Safari 4+. IE 9 yet does not support this though.</p>




<p>Now to find some practical use for this!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A year is almost over! I have reviewed about 80 books (&amp; collections) and read about 110 books in total! Not bad given all the mindless travel I have been doing. Here are the last reviews for this year!</p>




<h3>The Dispossessed: Living With Multiple Chemical Sensitivities</h3>




<p>I actually wanted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061054887?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061054887">The Dispossessed</a> that has been hailed as one of the best sci-fi books, but somehow got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0966157109?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0966157109">The Dispossessed: Living With Multiple Chemical Sensitivities</a> at the library :/</p>




<p>In the spirit of letting serendipity taking its course, I read it. It is a set of photo-narratives of people who consider themselves as victims of Multiple Chemical Sensitivities, with a variety of reactions to city-living. It is quite depressing read to see these people trying to find &#8220;cleaner&#8221; places to live in, losing the relationships they had.</p>




<h3>Zen in the Art of Writing: Essays on Creativity</h3>


<p>Ray Bradbury is an excellent writer of fiction, and in this book, sells the practice of writing, like a seasoned salesman. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1877741094?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1877741094">Zen in the Art of Writing: Essays on Creativity</a> is an excellent book because it is a book that practices what it preaches. There are no hidden gotchas or tips other than to keep thinking of ideas and practicing.</p>




<h3>Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error</h3>


<p>Kathy Schulz has a ball trying to understand why humans detest being wrong. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061176044?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061176044">Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error</a> is written in an entertaining and simple way (perhaps, too simplistic?) Each chapter explores stories of people who have discovered they were wrong in different areas of life and Kathy looks into how their life altered (or not) once they grasped that they were wrong. It is an excellent book to read if you would like to understand your own emotions when someone accuses you of being wrong.</p>




<h3>Merde Happens</h3>


<p>I originally wanted to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143055542?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143055542">Merde Actually</a>, but my <a href="http://spl.org">library</a> does not seem to have it, so I ended up reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596915277?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1596915277">Merde Happens</a>. If you have read PG Wodehouse, you would notice this book reeks of wannabe-ness. It is a page-turner, but not what I would turn to for humour.</p>




<h3>Hellboy</h3>


<p>I finally finished the 10 volumes of Hellboy. I have been reading them over a few months, but decided to review them all in one go (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595824774?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1595824774">10</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595824316?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1595824316">9</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159307896X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=159307896X">8</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593074751?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593074751">6</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593070950?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593070950">2</a>). Mike Mignola knows his myths and how to fashion a great story, not to mention find great artists to collaborate with. I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_for_Paranormal_Research_and_Defense">B.P.R.D</a>.</p>
