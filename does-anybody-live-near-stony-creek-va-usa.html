<div class="entry-content"><p>Ex-blogger Deepak, has just now been looted by this company called <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> of S$60, unfairly debited from his account for a web hosting service he did not want (rather called them up asking for a refund as clearly stated in the &#8220;100% money back guarantee&#8221;). All his calls to <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> were not picked up. <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> already debited a 60 dollars for the hosting service, and debited 60 dollars AGAIN today. Clearly its a breach of privacy. I am not sure how <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> got hold of his credit card number. Apparently, they had been sending him mails with some &#8220;Invoice not paid&#8221; again and again to which he had already responded his unwillingness to subscribe to a new plan and declined his intention to pay (Though he should have been alerted by then and should have cancelled his card at that time only, is something smart people like me would say ;) ).  On top of it, they cant even be reached on their <a href="http://kytec.com/contact.html">&#8220;customer services&#8221;</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> has a &#8220;Cancellation Request Form&#8221; (a link to which I can not even open) which a customer has to submit for cancellation to AVOID AUTOMATIC RENEWAL(emphasis mine). The words &#8220;Automatic renewal&#8217; are not used ANYWHERE ELSE tht describes these plans. And the phrase occurs only ONCE throughout the &#8220;terms and conditions&#8221;. If this itself is not criminal I don&#8217;t know what else is! The worst part is the <a href="http://support.kytec.com/?_a=tickets&_m=submit&PHPSESSID=a25e4d654dd2167c4e2f2e2f9560e382">link</a> does not work (nor does <a href="http://support.kytec.com">this</a>!).</p>

<p>So, my very humble request is to anybody living near this &#8220;Stony Creek VA&#8221; (or if thts phony, anybody who can call these numbers from USA during the daytime hours in USA)  to call up the <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> domestic numbers:</p>

<ul><li>(434) 246-3912</li>
<li>(888) 662-8216 x2</li>
<li>(434) 246-5717</li>
<li>(888) 662-8216</li>
</ul>


<p>and alert them to this criminal act, if you ever get your calls answered that is. Perhaps you can try it as a fun game to see if you strike the jackpot. Or when you have nothing to do and are struck in a traffic jam or freezing inside the house. The details to be provided are:</p>

<p>&#8220;Deepak Jois in Singapore has time and again tried to contact you to cancel the web hosting plans. He was not alerted even once to the existence of the Cancellation Form (a link to which does not even work!). Moreover, despite not attending any calls made by him, your company charged him another S$ 60 in an attempt to renew a non-existing plan. Please refund the S$60 (U.S. dollar 35 ) that was deducted on 9th July (Singapore time). &#8221;</p>

<p>Mail deepak.jois{!@#$remove these and the brackets#@!}@gmail.com if you are ever successful in hitting the jackpot. Perhaps he might have a surprise for you ;-)</p>

<p>If possible, I would love it if you can link back to this post and provide greater exposure to the criminal acts of <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> on all search engines and prevent any more innocent end users from getting fooled by <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a>.</p>
