  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read this article titled <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21800?source=rss">&#8220;Without God&#8221; by Steven Weinberg</a> a week ago and had to blog my thoughts on it.</p>

<p>The article is a very thoughtful analysis of the weakening of religious belief in countries with advanced science.</p>

<p>He attributes the causes for it to these:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Explanation of mysteries as natural occurrences with scientific explanations (e.g. floods, earthquakes, etc)</li>
    <li>These explanations have resulted in discounting of man as a special creation of God. Especially the discovery of evolution of man shows man is not a special saviour of the world.</li>
    <li>The faithful seem to believe that the idea of determinism (in terms of laws of motion, gravity, etc) is against the idea of a non-deterministic miracle-causing God.  </li>
    <li>Traditional religions have a belief in infallible prophets or gurus. But in a scientific world, even Einstein could be wrong. </li>
</ul>


<p>He then goes to talk about how to live without God. Here is the best part:</p>


<blockquote>
    <p>
        First, a warning: we had better beware of substitutes. It has often been noted that the greatest horrors of the twentieth century were perpetrated by regimes—Hitler&#8217;s Germany, Stalin&#8217;s Russia, Mao&#8217;s China—that while rejecting some or all of the teachings of religion, copied characteristics of religion at its worst: infallible leaders, sacred writings, mass rituals, the execution of apostates, and a sense of community that justified exterminating those outside the community.      
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was an undergraduate I knew a rabbi, Will Herberg, who worried about my lack of religious faith. He warned me that we must worship God, because otherwise we would start worshiping each other. He was right about the danger, but I would suggest a different cure: we should get out of the habit of worshiping anything.      
    </p>
</blockquote>


<p>
    The article rightly then focuses on how to deal with the clinical nature of a scientific belief - the idea that our entire outlook, speech, belief, actions are explained by chemical reactions within the body.  All in all a great read for all non-believers and agnostics!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/books/1590598393/web-design-marketing-solutions-business-websites">Web Design Marketing Solutions for Business Websites</a> last week and here is my review of the book.</p>


<p>The book is a summary of list of techniques and details that goes into creating a full-fledged business website for an enterprise. It is a book that is a useful reference to check if you have covered your bases with respect to all aspects of your website and as a starting point to doing more with your website. It is not the holy bible of business websites though. </p>


<p>It is written by the creator of <a href="http://graphicpush.com/">GraphicPush</a>: <a href="http://kevinpottsdesign.com/about/">Kevin Potts</a> - which is why it seems to focus a lot on the building of the website rather than on making the website thrive in the face of competition and keeping the website alive.</p>


<h3>The Good</h3>


<p>There are some good tips on creating a corporate blog such as:</p>


<ul>
<li>Blog about information directly related to the company.</li>
<li>Blog about information related to the writers of the blog.</li>
<li>Write about the industry the company is in.</li>
</ul>


<p>It also mentions some good blogging policies:</p>


<ul>
<li>Respond to feedback</li>
<li>Never delete a comment unless it violates the commenting policy</li>
<li>Never write anything knowingly false</li>
<li>Always double check accuracy and spelling.</li>
<li>Provide a link to any cited webpage or document.</li>
</ul>


<p>The book also covers different kinds of pages that can validate your claims about a product or service, such as:</p>


<ul>
<li>Press Releases</li>
<li>Case Studies</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Awards and Recognition</li>
<li>Customer List</li>
</ul>


<p>The book talks about how to obtain case studies/testimonials from customers with tips on how to write press releases and generate the customer list.</p>


<h3>The Bad</h3>


<p>I found the sections on online advertising and marketing very lacking. There are lots of advertising techniques like roadblocks, paid ads, text ads, sponsored reviews. But these are covered very vaguely in the section. </p>


<p>The Use of social media is also not covered. I must agree this book must have come out before social media became such a big deal. Perhaps, newer editions of the book will cover it.</p>


<h3>In Summary</h3>


<p>This is a good book for beginners who are looking to redesign, or create from scratch, a business website, but you need to look beyond this book for learning anything in-depth about running a business website.</p>


<p>I am looking forward to reading <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/books/0470174625/landing-page-optimization-definitive-guide-testing">Landing Page Optimization: The Definitive Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions</a> and <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/books/0470130652/web-analytics-hour-day">Web Analytics: An Hour a Day</a> to learn more about the business side of running a website.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across this great list of usability rules in a presentation by Denise Stephen called &#8220;Enabled by Design meets Scripting Enabled&#8221; which was given as part of the <a href="http://scriptingenabled.org/presentations/">Scripting Enabled</a> event organized by <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heilmann</a>. Here goes the list:</p>


<h3>Usability - The golden rules</h3>


<br/><ul>


<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;Simply presented information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content reduced to essentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manageable logical structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intuitive usability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniform appearance, consistently designed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good design and appealing graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick delivery of information&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></ul><p>There are some great slides at ScriptingEnabled which are up on Slideshare - like this one <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cheilmann/why-i-hate-the-interweb-kath-moonan-at-scripting-enabled-presentation">Why I hate the Interweb</a> (a presentation on the challenges that face different kinds of disabled users online).

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has not sunk in yet, despite having made plans for it more than a year now. This would be the longest period I have been away from Singapore since I came here in 2000.</p>


<p> <p>Singapore is the place I grew up. Coming here as a gawky 16 year old, Singapore was a big culture shock and I spent more than 6 months recovering from it and getting out of home sickness. Singapore is where I got my first email account - in 2000 (fell into disuse by the time gmail came by!). Singapore is where I found <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> and it is where we got married. It is here that I learned everything about webdesign.</p><p>Singapore is home to a lot of friends who have been through the same pains and trials as I have. Those whom I know for more than 8 years. Singapore is also home to some of the <a href="http://tribolum.com">best</a> <a href="http://pebbleroad.com">people</a> I know. </p><p>Singapore food grew on me. Being a vegetarian, it was (still is) hard to find authentic singaporean vegetarian food. I know how much I will miss my Teh Halia and Honey prata. Not to mention the delicious Buddhist vegetarian fare of Bukit Merah and my favourite mock stuff - A bowl of hot and spicy mock prawn noodles soup.</p> <p>I will miss Arab street. Most of all I will miss the National Library. Through <a href="http://bookjetty.co">Bookjetty</a> and the NLB I have borrowed countless books. Read more about Africa (my flavour of the year) than I could possibly keep up with. </p><p>Singapore meant comfort and safety. I know I will miss it terribly when I am gone. Glad to know it will not be long before I come back.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Indian Roads are living, thriving economic entities that not many Indians pay attention to. It takes an outsider to recognize how noisily vibrant the market on the roads is.</p>


<p></p>

<p>The reason I mention is, a lot of Economics books write about the unorganized sectors in developing nations and how no appropriate metrics exist to measure the economic implications of such a sector. Each nation develops its own set of products that satisfy the needs of the unorganized sector. For example, you will not find fried-insect sellers or fried Chicken sellers anywhere in India but are quite common in Thailand or Cambodia.</p>


<p>I have tried to create a list of vendors and the kind of products or services they sell with specific reference to them operating out of Indian Roads. Their USP seems to be the ability to be agile and escape the laws (which sometimes ban selling on the roadside) by quickly sprinting on a cycle at the sight of cops.</p>


<ul>
    <li><strong>Watchmen:</strong> They are strictly not road side vendors, but still their work gets done mostly on the road side. Most houses employ old ex-army (or simply old) men as &#8220;Watchmen&#8221;. They are not security guards nor are they healthy enough to catch a thief. They simply deter unwanted people from entering the premises. </li>
    <li><strong>Tailors:</strong> Each road has at least 1 tailor plying his trade under the shade of a large tree. They are mostly quite cheap and deliver on time. </li>
    <li><strong>Ragpickers:</strong> They are responsible for strewing the waste outside the garbage bin.</li>
    <li><strong>Peanut Vendors:</strong> Either roasted or plain peanuts are sold in push carts. </li>
    <li><strong>Old Newspaper Vendors:</strong> If you have old newspapers, they are the ones that collect them and pay <em>YOU</em> money after weighing the amount of old newspapers you have. </li>
    <li><strong>Plastic Container Vendors:</strong> In India, water shortage is acute and there is a lot of demand for large plastic containers. Bringing one from a store is a lot of hassle (given that most Indians have two-wheelers rather than four-wheelers). These vendors carry huge plastic containers on their cycles (don&rsquo;t ask me how they do it!) and barter it for old clothes. </li>
    <li><strong>Cobbler:</strong> They shout out &#8220;Jod Repair&#8221; (where &#8220;Jod&#8221; is an antiquated word for &#8220;Footwear&#8221;) as they walk by.</li> 
    <li><strong>Barbers:</strong> In Northern India, it is quite common to see road side barbers who also deliver a good hair massage.</li>
    <li><strong>Flower Seller:</strong> They sell flowers that idol-worshipping Hindus put on the illustrations of Gods and Goddesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegetable Vendors:</strong> They sell vegetables at slightly higher prices than usual as they push their cart from one house to the other. </li>
    <li><strong>Banana Vendors:</strong> In South India, it is more common to see banana specific vendors who sell at least 3 varieties of banana. </li>
    <li><strong>Fruit Sellers:</strong> They generally sell anything other than bananas (if bananas they sell some exotic variety of Bananas). </li>
    <li><strong>Astrologers:</strong> I suspect they are a dying race. </li>
    <li><strong>Coconut Vendors:</strong> They are mostly found in South Indian states where coconut water is a good thirst quencher and a good &#8220;cooling&#8221; solution for braving the heat. Not to mention, it is cheaper than any of the &#8220;cool&#8221; drinks.</li>
    <li><strong>Chaat Vendor:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaat">&#8220;Chaat&#8221;</a> is a specific variety of North Indian Snacks. Even in South India they usually sell some of these items on the road side. </li>
    <li><strong>Tea Vendors:</strong> They usually ply their trade in cycles carrying big containers of hot tea and plastic cups to serve them in. They come around morning 9 a.m. and evening 3 p.m. Their usual customers are other roadside vendors like Watchmen, Tailors, Newspaper men, etc.</li> 
    <li>
        <strong>Stuffed Toys Sellers:</strong> These guys are very smartly dressed and use parked cars to showcase the kind of stuffed toys they have. Most of the time, all of them sell the same kinds of toys from China which are usually stuffed big toy tigers or teddy bears.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ear Cleaners:</strong> Though not a part of the South Indian road market, these people are quite a force in North India. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Temple Priests:</strong> In many roads of India, temples awkwardly jut out into the roads (they cant be demolished as they will cause an uproar in religious India). Priests either belonging to neighbouring temple or dedicated to that temple start early morning&rsquo;s ablutions for the Gods. It is also common to see small temples for Virgin Mary.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mike Davidson has written about his <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2008/08/design-signatures">design signature</a> which has inspired me to write about the elements of my web design signature. As he had mentioned, it seems following my signature leads to no or negligible use for IE specific style sheets.</p>


<p><strong>Update:</strong> There is another informative article on <a href="http://anthonyshort.com.au/blog/comments/how-to-get-cross-browser-compatibility-everytime/">getting cross-browser compatibility every time</a>.</p>


<ol>
    <li>
    <h3>Use only Classes</h3>
    <p>I use ids only if there are javascripts that require one. Makes my styles a lot more re-usable and I don&rsquo;t have to remember whether I used an id or a Class in the HTML when I write my CSS code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Use Reset CSS</h3>
    <p><a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/">Eric Meyer&rsquo;s Reset CSS</a> with the <code>vertical-align:baseline</code> commented out works well for me. <code>vertical-align:baseline</code> does not allow HTML elements with set &#8220;align&#8221; attributes, to display correctly aligned in IE (and plays havoc with widgets that use inline styles and attributes).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Using a clear &lt;div&gt;</h3>
    <p>I use <code>&lt;div class=&quot;clear&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> and define in the CSS <code>div.clear { clear:both; }</code> to clear floats. Read more <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html">about clearing floats</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Use a fixed width layout</h3>
        <p>I use a fixed width layout with a center align on the <code>body</code> and left align for the child <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (with margins set to auto). I use floats rather than position for layouts and for anything whose position is fixed (e.g. the header navigation section), I use absolute positioning.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Use starting and closing comment tags</h3>
        <p>I use Textmate&rsquo;s snippets to automatically add a comment that states <code>&lt;!--START CLASS &lt;name&gt;--&gt;</code> next to each <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and at the closing tag <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> adds the comment <code>&lt;!--END CLASS &lt;name&gt;--&gt;</code> &mdash; where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the name of the class assigned to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></p>
        <p>The snippet I use is:</p>
        <pre>
<code>&lt;div class=&quot;${1:name}&quot;&gt;&lt;!--START CLASS ${1:name}--&gt;
  ${0:$TM_SELECTED_TEXT}
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--END CLASS ${1:name}--&gt;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Use <code>display:inline</code> for all floated elements</h3><p>This takes care of the double margin bug for IE.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Use the png-fix</h3>
    <p>Most of the designs I work on, have some element of transparency - which require the use of the <a href="    http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/">png-fix</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Use a conditional IE CSS</h3>
        <p>I use a conditional IE-6 and IE-7 CSS stylesheet. Mostly they contain less than 2 or 3 lines. But it is better to keep them separate from modern CSS without using hacks for individual browsers.</p>        
    </li>
    <li><h3>Use margins rather than padding</h3>
    <p>I rarely use padding (and am very careful with borders) on elements with width specified. This is because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_box_model_bug">Box Model Bug</a> in IE as compared to other modern browsers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Use <code>vertical-align:middle</code></h3>
        <p>For aligning inline <code>img</code> with any other inline element &mdash; especially images which are longer rather than wider. <a href="http://phrogz.net/CSS/vertical-align/index.html">Read more about Vertical Aligning</a> (update: <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/2008/10/05/vertical-align/">another great article on vertical align</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Keyword Autocomplete</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/keyword_autocomplete</p>


<p>Keyword Autocomplete lets you add autocomplete functionality to your site&#8217;s search forms based on previously searched strings. The module saves keyword strings entered in search forms and increments a counter for the strings on subsequent searches. It then populates an autocomplete on search forms from these saved keyword strings in order of the most searched keywords to the least.</p>


<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Top Searches</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/top_searches</p>


<p>Supplies a block with a list of the top search phrases on the site. Useful for generating inward traffic within the site to older blog posts that generally do not get featured on the front page.</p>


<p></p>

<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5 (stable)</p>




<h3>Search Autocomplete</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/search_autocomplete</p>


<p>This module allows you to add autocomplete functionality on search fields in Drupal. It offers a drop down box of a list of results as you start typing.</p>




<h3>Related Terms</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/related_terms</p>


<p>Terms are related to each other if they appear on the same node. The more nodes they appear on together, the bigger they will be displayed in the cloud.</p>


<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5 (no stable release)</p>




<h3>Tip Joy</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/tipjoy</p>


<p>Tipjoy is a service that allows bloggers to collect tips from happy readers. Bloggers can either add “tip this” buttons to each blog post or just put up a general “leave a tip” banner somewhere on their site. On its front page, Tipjoy.com keeps track of tips given and received throughout the world, showing off the most tipped content, and featuring new content worth checking out.</p>


<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5 (stable) and Drupal 6 (beta 2)</p>




<h3>Archive By Terms</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/archive_by_terms</p>


<p>This provides a block which lists all the terms of a vocabulary. Each term is then split up into years. So for example you have a vocabulary &#8220;General&#8221; and in this vocabulary you would have 3 Terms. This Module would now generate the following structure:</p>


<ul>
<li>Term 1
  <ul>
    <li>2008</li>
    <li>2007</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Term 2
    <ul>
    <li>2007</li>
    <li>2006</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>For: </strong>Drupal 6 (Beta 2)</p>




<h3>Unreleased Modules</h3>


<h3>Sphinx</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/sphinx</p>


<p>This module integrates the Sphinx full-text search daemon with Drupal. Sphinx is a full-text search engine, distributed under GPL version 2. See more at http://sphinxsearch.com</p>


<p>The module provides a search form and result pages. </p>


<p>Plans for this module includes:</p>


<ul>
<li>An search phrase spelling suggestion add-on module using pspell</li>
<li>Multiple indexes and multiple attributes</li>
<li>Faceted Search - using MVA&#8217;s and groupBy features</li>
<li>A way to autogenerate the Sphinx daemon configuration</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>For:</strong> no release yet</p>




<h3>Moodle</h3>


<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/moodle</p>


<p>Integration of the Moodle Course Management System with Drupal.</p>


<p><strong>For:</strong> no release yet</p>




<h3>Robots for Thought</h3>


<p>An interesting article on <a href="http://drupalzilla.com/robots-txt">why Drupal&#8217;s default robots.txt file is flawed and how we can make it better</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found myself book-less on an MRT ride and looked around for something to do. I chanced upon the 10% Power Savings Campaign one of which claims:</p>


<blockquote>Standb power can add upto 10% of your bill. Switch off appliances at the power socket to save about $50* a year!
<small>* based on electricity tariff of $0.2388 per unit KWh, assuming 35W of standby power in a given home.</small></blockquote>


<p>Now, it stands to reason that 10% of my monthly bill equals about $4 of power savings ($50/12) per month. Does that mean my monthly bill is only $40?</p>


<p>In an other advertisement in the same train, they claim 10% of your monthly bill can be saved by setting the temperature on the air-con 2 degrees higher than usual which comes to $50 <em>per month</em>. So now, my monthly bill equals $500!</p>


<p>I like maths, and am annoyed when people disregard maths just for the sake of a &#8220;10%&#8221; campaign. Would be a lot more effective if you give me the <em>real</em> statistics, instead of a fake 10% number.</p>
