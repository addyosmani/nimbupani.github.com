  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those smiles.</p>

<p>Those won me over, erasing my resentment and anger at waking up at 6 on a sunday morning, getting ready and going to a place that didnt even exist in the Street Directory.</p>

<p>I saw the kids as they were practising their well rehearsed song. Andy was exactly like Calvin, picking up a fight with the a big guy (who looked like Moe!) and of course in this case, Susie was there to support Calvin!</p>

<p>There were twenty of them, creating a ruckus in the <a href="http://www.starhub.net.sg/~nc0066/html/history.htm">Chen Su Lan Methodist Children&#8217;s Home</a> somewhere in Serengoon Gardens. The Chindren&#8217;s Home houses kids from 4-12 who come from broken homes, abusive or poor families.</p>

<p>We were around ten, led by Vrush, who had thought and planned the whole thing. The plan was to take the kids to an oldage home and let them play with the oldies there.</p>

<p>And so we did. It was a riot.</p>

<p>Old People Nursing Home Caretaker: &#8220;The old people eat five times a day&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Dawn (seven years old): &#8220;SO MANY TIMES AH!&#8221; </em></p>

<p>The kids played dodgeball with the oldies enthusiastically. The whole place was filled with joy, happiness and excitement. I have never been so excited in my life.</p>

<p>Then, the cameras were fished out. And instantly, the only thing the world was made up of was the camera. Kids were milling around, wanting to be photographed.</p>

<p><em>Six year old Kid: &#8220;Only girls do like this.&#8221; (showing the V sign 90 degrees rotated, near the eyes).</p>

<p>Ry and Shao: &#8220;Stand with us for the photo.&#8221; </em></p>

<p>A ten year old kid was asking if the old people fight. Startled, I asked why she thought so, and she said she overheard a person saying so. I didnt want to know what her story was. I was afraid.</p>

<p>Me (holding out chocolates): &#8220;Take as much as you want!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ry takes one.</p>

<p>Me: Take as much as you want! The teacher wont say anything!</p>

<p><em>Ry grabs as much as she can with her small nimble fingers.</em></p>

<p><em>Ry (clever to avoid the teacher catching her in the act): Hold these for me till we finish.</em></p>

<p>Oh, I loved every moment of it! And I thought I will come back within an hour, but ended up staying till the end.</p>

<p>What I got present to was the miracle of happiness. We, so called &#8220;privileged&#8221; people, didnt have one tenth of the happiness of the kids at the Children&#8217;s Home. And at that moment, I just saw how in the apparent quest for happiness, what we gather simply pave the way for more sadness (&#8220;i wish I had more of money! more branded goods! More shoes! More bags! more money -did I say that before? more..&#8221;).</p>

<p>The kids taught me.</p>

<p><em>All it takes to be happy is a chocolate.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know there are diseases that are gender dependent (rather harmone dependent), but I didnt know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue">Dengue</a> was also gender dependent! Today, I saw somebody reading the &#8216;Home&#8217; section of <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/">Straits Times</a> on the MRT which carried a huge illustration of how Dengue infects men and women. The first half was about dengue mosquitoes infecting men and the second half was about how infected women inturn infect the mosquitoes!</p>

<p>A google search <a href="http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/d/dengue_fever/causes.htm">didnt yield any link to women being the only people who can infect the mosquitoes with dengue virus (to make them carriers)</a>. Is it true? Can anyone confirm this?</p>

<p>(I cant access the Straitstimes website as it is paid membership =()</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As <a href="http://Mitokondrion.blogspot.com">Mitokondrion</a> says, it was simply an act of political correctness to show the cycle of Dengue in Singapore (use men first and then women). Perhaps the caption should have been well formed instead of putting it as <em>&#8216;women infect mosquitoes&#8217;</em> it could be something like &#8216;patient infects mosquitoes&#8217;- definitely less gender biased!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally watched Sin City with great trepidation. My past with violent movies has not been good. I watched 90% of Kill Bill with eyes closed or spouting &#8216;Disgusting&#8217; every few seconds - which is why I was very reluctant to watch Sin City.</p>

<p>But, several people did, and thankfully all of them gave it a huge thumbs up. So, I was agreeable to watching it and finally did so yesterday night.</p>

<p>Sin City is art. Sorry, if you thought it was a film. It is aesthetic, stylish, retro, ugly and beautiful at the same time. Sin City pictured in the typical comic book format <a href="http://www.filmrot.com/images/sincity-comparisons/sincity.html">brings the comic book alive - literally</a>.  Sin City stories are not relevant - not enough as the direction and picturisation.</p>

<p>The best of all is the narration, the first person narration that is so comic book style. And you just totally relate to it. There are more monologues than there are dialogues.</p>

<p>Oh, even better, the blood. THere isnt any. Not in the form you know atleast. There is white, there is yellow, there is some spongy looking red. But nothing, close to what you think is reality. When limbs, head or penises get cut off, you dont experience horror, or disgust, but simply marvel at how amazingly cool the scene is.</p>

<p>I also loved the cars. Man, those cars! Lovely.</p>

<p>The stories are interestingly threaded together.  If the movie was so aesthetic, I am sure the book will be even better!</p>

<p>P.S. Read <a href="http://wired-vig.wired.com/wired/archive/13.04/sincity_pr.html">the wired article on Robert Rodrigues, the co-director of Sin City</a> and <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1493058,00.html">Guardian&#8217;s Profile of Frank Miller</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The design for Jflickruploader was completed one night, two weeks ago and has finally seen the light of the day.</p>

<p>THe interesting part of this design is that it uses no images (except for the &#8220;I Power Blogger&#8221; image) and hence should be really fast to download.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have seen Deepak with this <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Gnome/Applications/Tomboy">Tintin software</a> (it has the logo of Tintin!), which I have fallen in love with. Sadly <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Gnome/Applications/Tomboy">Tomboy</a> (thats the tintin software) ships only for linux =(</p>

<p>Also, Deepak inspired me to start into &#8220;organizing my life&#8221; which had pretty much become murky muddy water with tonnes of work piling over other incomplete ones. Seeing how he actually got value from the book, i started on it.</p>

<p>Ahem, er, I dont do it as throughly as he does, (my list is just a huge pile!), but I guess you can! Head over to <a href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com/2005/09/gtd-with-linux-gnome-and-tomboy.html">his entry on GTD with Linux</a> for organizing your life and work!</p>
