  <div class="entry-content"><p>Crossposted at <a href="http://www.naachgaana.com/item/1212/catid/5">Naachgaana</a>.</p>

<p>I had the good fortune of watching this relic, that I have never seen before (I usually discover the oldies on the T.V.) and it was such a hilarious experience!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0270219/">Baat Ban Jaye</a> was released in 1986 - just in time for the horrible 80s. It is striking to see what 80s does to people. Zeenat is the main actor in the movie. She has horrid fluffy hair ( which seems to be mismash of the 60s &#8220;buffo&#8221;), loose frocks which are ultra tight at the hips (like in the 60s except the frocks reached beyond the knees in the 80s and were synthetic).  On the whole, 80s was the era when digital equipments and new materials were discovered and people didnt know what to do with them.</p>

<p>This is obvious from the advertisements. The doorbells that chime in our houses these days appear in jingles :) Everything is shiny, and with fake animal prints. Even the names of the products sound funny now you think of it (&#8220;Lure&#8221;, &#8220;Fabxotica&#8221;, &#8220;Vicco&#8221;, etc).</p>

<p>Now, Baat Ban Jaye is one of the early movies when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim">Denim</a> wave started and &#8220;low cut was unheard of&#8221;. We had denims that ended up much above the hips, just like the pants in the 50s and 60s did. Zeenat also wears the &#8220;Business Woman&#8221; suits, one of the early indian actors to do so.</p>

<p>Men&#8217;s fashion had lost their appeal, but surprisingly, moustaches made a big come back - a drastic change from the 70s. Perhaps it is reflective of the &#8220;Afro&#8221; craze that was left over from the 70s.  I remember my dad&#8217;s big moushtache that he didnt have in the 70s :). You can see several side actors in the movie who sport big moustaches. This is better reflected in Tamil movies where moustaches have always signified &#8220;male strength&#8221; and the early 80s movies (Rajnikanth especially!) had the male actors sporting the &#8220;afro&#8221; look with moustaches.</p>

<p>This film is a riot if you are looking for The 80s design. Also, Utpal Dutt looks almost identical to the character he portrayed in <a href="http://207.171.166.140/title/tt0079221/">Golmaal</a> which was one of those late 70s film.</p>

<p>P.S. <a href="http://www.fashion-era.com/1980s_lifestyle_and_fashion.htm">Fashion Era</a> captures the best and the worst of the 80s around the world. Please note the extra bright blues and yellows. :)</p>

<p>P.P.S. <a href="http://www.inthe80s.com/clothes/index.shtml">In The 80s</a> is the best source for everything about the 80s!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Crossposted at <a href="http://www.naachgaana.com/item/1197">Naachgaana</a></p>

<p>Sorry for the long delay in my posts. I have no excuses :)</p>

<p>I recently bought the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158026/">Night in London</a> VCD, and London looks dramatically different from what we see today. But still, the need to have one firang to act dumb existed even during those days!</p>

<p>Night in London has Mala Sinha in another Mystery Thriller. Her costumes are run of the mill. What is interesting is how vast and empty london looks. Also, the scarcity of Indian immigrant population also means, the film does not include them in the characters.</p>

<p>But new movies, are not so isolated from the environment where they are shot at. There are firangi chracters doing a few roles that justify the location and give life to the chracters in the movie, unlike movies like &#8220;Night in London&#8221;. Perhaps, being one of the earlier attempts to create larger than life pictures, we can forgive the movie directors for simply using the venues as backgrounds and not integrating them into the story line.</p>

<p>Night in London, also shows the discrepancy in the fashion sensibilities of India and U.K. The costumes that the Indians wear are in sharp contrast to those worn by the British who appear in the background of the movie. Comparing that to current movie scenes, you can hardly see the difference in clothes!  I guess, that is what globalization does to you! In a way, the unique design sense of Indian fashion is becoming less and less unique!</p>

<p>This movie is not worthy of your time, even if you wish to feast on retro London imagery.</p>

<li>A redesign. Has been on the pipeline for more than a year. It still continues to be.</li>
<li>Movie reviews. I have slacked off on my commitment to Naachgana. I havent written many posts there despite the popularity of my weekly updates.</li>
<li><a href="http://salonsolidarity.blogspot.com/">SalonSolidarity</a>. I joined this awesome group blog and have never been to an art gallery since. I am deeply embarassed by this action of mine. :( </li>
<li>Usability Posts. I had several in mind, but I never posted them anywhere</li>
<li><a href="http://www.publicgyan.com/">Public Gyan</a>. I havent taken any initiative in this awesome prediction market.</li>
<li>My Cambodia trip. Lots of planning, never got done</li>
<li>I also wanted to do graphic illustrations, but have managed only three.</li>
<li>Waking up early. Never managed to do that yet!</li></ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had posted about this before in <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2005/07/26/are_they_us.php">Are They Us</a> (not coherently perhaps), but the moot problem of globalization has been the challenges to the definition of &#8220;national identity&#8221;. British, French, American, German, and other countries with a long history of National Identity are having great clashes of thought on what national identiy (and therefore &#8220;culture&#8221;) means to them and how the newer brown, yellow, and black citizens of their countries fit.</p>

<p>These countries, like Singapore, are obliged to represent their citizens with a sample face from each race. And the more each country does that, the more the countries looks the same. A P G Wodehouse is no longer enough to appreciate &#8220;britishness&#8221;.</p>

<p>And that is what the citizens are not willing to come to terms with - the uncertainity in their culture and demography. And the &#8220;blame&#8221; goes to the immigrants who come from &#8220;outside&#8221; for this &#8220;change&#8221;. It is no surprise that we have globalization of riots. The outsiders forever remain outsiders. (India, faces the same situation with respect to Bangladeshis and Tibetians and Indians have reacted identically to the French, Australians, and British).</p>

<p>But, what we have not come to terms with, is that national identity is a changing phenomenon. The Amerindians could never have imagined their nation overrun with caucasians nor the elimination of their culture nor the aborigines. And everytime there is a threat to a culture, there is war.</p>

<p>And this is the challenge we face today. People refusing to deal with the process of creating and defining their evolved culture and clinging to the images of the past.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was drowning in work, I got this sticker in my mail day before.  A few seconds of humour in the sea of &#8220;busy&#8221;ness.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/sticker.jpg" alt="down with helvetica stickers"/></p>

<p>Meanwhile, I forgot to announce our temporary lodger Jace, who is temporarily camping at ashwink&#8217;s room for a week before he heads back home!</p>

<p>Also, my dear fridge has broken down, hours after I got groceries to stock up the fridge. I am having a hard time recollecting my mum&#8217;s advice on fridge-less existence and storage of food. I do not see a point to living a life without a fridge :)</p>

<p>I spotted these amazing Amerindians performing at The Amara Hotel. Just look at their costumes! How can it not be attractive! Any girl should fall for such awesome get up :)</p>

<p>They were playing some spanish hits on a different types of flute and spanish guitar to the music from the keyboard. These guys are from Ecuador (pronounced &#8220;Equadhor&#8221;) and will be performing next in Plaza Singapura from today till Monday. Catch them before they go all the way back to Ameeerica! Probably this is the closest I can get to South America! :)</p>

<p>Dont miss their awesome ornaments from Peru, Ecador, and other South American countries (cheap enough I would say!). Hurry!</p>

<p>P.S. Apparently, I look <i>Brazilian</i>. The amerindians all agreed on their assessment of my &#8220;nativity&#8221; as a Brazilian. Though they did give me an outside chance of being an <i>Indian</i>! I think I can easily join CIA as a spy given the number of nationalities I can assume :P</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aeon Flux is not the run of the mill sci-fi movie (like I, Robot) but has several elements that parallels Matrix in its concept and execution even though it doesnt postulate new philosophies.</p>

<p>Aeon Flux has the best portrayal of cloning I have ever seen on screen (after the horror show of island) and it postulates a theory that your experiences somehow get into your DNA and when you get cloned, your experiences remain with you as &#8220;bad dreams&#8221;. Perhaps, this explains why people know what they were in their &#8220;past lives&#8221; (Except, sadly, this theory isnt true!). So, Aeon Flux compensates for such a theory with vivid imagination, that seems compellingly real.</p>

<p>Conferences happen within your brain, skin treatment band aids are instantly available. The only thing that doesnt change are the guns. You STILL need guns to fire and fight (and I think the only reason that is necessary is because the directors assume the audience cannot relate to any other form of violent acts).  People exchange their feet for their hands, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The movie is also quite feminist. The lead male actor is content to fiddle with his chemicals while the female lead tackles the men, bullets, and pointy grass!</p>

<p>Watch it if you havent oredi.</p>
