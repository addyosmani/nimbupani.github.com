  <div class="entry-content"><p>My grey cells have been inactive for quite a while on what topics to blog about. The only entries that suggest themselves are movie reviews (coming up: &#8220;War of the Worlds&#8221; and &#8220;Aeon Flux&#8221;).</p>

<p>The sooner I acknowledge this breakdown in blogging, the faster I can make a choice regarding this blog! This may partially be due to my <a href="http://nimbupani.com/2005/12/02/new_commitments.php">several commitments</a> (blogging, &#8220;incidentally&#8221;, isnt listed as one of them!) or my sudden leap of faith as regards to feed reading. Finally, I have managed to get rid of the addiction to reading feeds, and it feels good!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cross-posted at <a href="http://naachgaana.com/index.php?itemid=1051">NaachGaana</a></p>

<p>80s is an age that cant be classified. The early 80s enjoyed the 70s hangover with a resurgence of the 60s style, which later morphed into the disastrous and much hated 80s look (one look at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093578/">Mr. India</a> and you know what I am talking about). Karz, thankfully, is the child of the early 80s and established Subhash Ghai in the league of Nassir Hussain (when it comes to style).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214841/">Karz</a> has everything going for a successful movie, it was a first in the film industry for innovative titles (the titles are props for the first song) and had catchy numbers extravagantly choreographed on the nimble footed Rishi Kapoor.</p>

<p>In the early 80s, the 70s shoulder button fashion are replaced with chest pocket fashion (bold strokes near the chest area), while the style still was stuck at tight shirts and bell bottoms, The afro look was in too -you can see men tottering around with thick curly hair in the movie. Glitz came back with a vengance and made it imperative that everything from top to toe glitter (which became worse in the late 80s). Karz has glittering balls and completely silver/gold costumes for Rishi Kapoor.  The female dressing still reflected the 70s a little, but took a turn for worse with tiny jackets over the blouses and tight fit near the hip (like the 60s) and skirts that reach just beyond the knee.</p>

<p>The style elements of the disaster that was 80s are evident in the movie. Simi Garewal wears a horrible red costume (hat, jacket and pants).</p>

<p>Karz is the kitsch mix that is unforgettable and grips you with the storyline however improbable! Karz embodies the best style of the 80s and glitters among the style disaster that was the 80s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.goethe.de/ins/sg/sin/en735864.htm">The German Movie Festival</a> is in full swing. My first German movie was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357/">Goodbye Lenin</a> and now I got to see another one: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311320/">Blindspot</a>.</p>

<p>Blindspot is where Hitler&#8217;s secretary finally speaks out (after fifty years of silence) on the last few days of Hitler&#8217;s regime.</p>

<p>Blindspot is really a long interview with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traudl_Junge">Traudl Junge</a> (Hitler&#8217;s Secretary). As some critic said, &#8220;the real movie happens in the audience&#8217;s heads as they imagine her tale&#8221;. Traudl Junge is an excellent narrator whose gripping narration just captures your imagination.</p>

<p>Traudl Junge lived in a blindspot. She did not know of the jewish massacres till the Neuremberg trials. Even when living so close to Hitler, she never heard the word &#8220;jew&#8221; mentioned in the bunker or concentration camps and what purposes they served. As she speaks, you can totally relate to her side of the story and see how much it must have troubled her 50 years of existence afterwards! She didnt forgive herself, as she knew she could have found out by some means about what was happening, but didnt bother to ( The guilt increased after she learned later about the execution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl">Sophie Scholl</a> who was almost the same age as Traudl when she was executed ).</p>

<p>Traudl has mixed feelings about Hitler - of paternal love and hate. In the film, she was yet to come to terms with it. At the end of the movie it was written that the day before she died, she had told the movie producers that &#8220;I am beginning to forgive myself&#8221;.</p>

<p>God knows, how many such countless people still suffer from their guilt. I suspect, Germany as a whole is still suffering from guilt of the holocaust. And, time will not heal the pain but merely lead to memory loss. Like charity, forgiveness begins at home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just recently planned my paintings which resulted in two good ones. Now, reading the Artists Manual is like finding a treasure house and I just cant wait to complete it and start painting with the new found knowledge of art resource management :) So now that the year is coming to an end here are a list of things I  am committed to doing:</p>

<ul><li>One Graphic Illustration Per Week</li>
<li>One painting every two weeks</li>
<li>Gym every week</li>
<li>Swimming every two weeks</li>
<li>Be in communication with friends every two weeks (atleast!)</li>
<li>Participate in <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001766.html">Word It</a> for December</li>
<li>Read the 10+ graphic design e-books and books by Jan 15th 2005</li>
<li>Set up automated backups and version control process for my illustrations and designs by next week</li>
<li>Review two artists works every month</li>
<li>Review a movie every week</li>
</ul>


<p>That should be enough for now. And you, as my readers, do make sure I honour these words :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you visit the <a href="http://www.nlb.gov.sg">National Library&#8217;s homepage</a> you can see the several lines devoted to the digitised Singapore collection which are available online. The only problem is they all open in hideous popups for which you need to be an acrobat so that you right click at the right time on IE before IE popup blocker deletes the popup. This has, no doubt, added more to the flexibility of my fingers ( mebbe I can now do a 360 degree rotation of my fingers now), but I do fear many others will not have such remarkable positive thoughts of such implementation.</p>

<p>I do know that NLB hires usability specialists to give recommendations. I guess there is many a slip between the cup and the lip and what gets churned out in the end are just trimphant opinions of a majority in the development team while the usability factors get erased.</p>

<p>I just called up the NLB and found out that I need to disable popup blocker in IE everytime I need to access the digitised content (no, they do not support Firefox access and they will feedback my request to put that on their website to the technical team). And forget about using firefox. I wonder what mac users will have to do. And the answer I get from them is that <b>&#8220;it is designed in that way (to use popups) because we use PDFs and that is the only way&#8221;</b>. And refresh the page every few minutes for the links to remain active. The ideas are so absurd that I was absolutely stunned to silence.</p>

<p>I cant tell you the anguish in my heart. A whole technical team designs the software and implements it without batting an eyelid for usability. This is precisely why e-governance will not work in singapore. You cant expect thousands of people to change their internet options and remove popup blocker. I cant emphasise more on how good the popup blocker is and how much it stops unsuspecting people from clicking and downloading some worms and virus.</p>

<p>I just hope <a href="http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/">RamblingLibrarian</a> can do something about it and make the singaporean digital library a saner place.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been hearing a lot about metadata ever since Flickr became the next best thing after scrambled eggs. The consistent refrain is a question on how seamless it can get. The past few years we have seen a consolidation and clear market leaders emerging on the internet which then led to the next challenge how to manage the data associated with them?</p>

<p>Flickr was one of the firsts to provide an answer - through APIs. Even though it is quite basic, flickr allows u to choose which applications you would like to authenticate and allow full access to once the correct credentials are provided to flickr by that application. And there were several that sprung up - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/">List of Flickr Apps</a></p>

<p>Dirk Knemeyer writes on <a rhef="http://dev.uxmatters.com/MT/archives/000016.php">Data—The Essence of a Digital Lifestyle</a> about how he found it difficult to move from Netflix to other providers because of the wealth of information that has been invested with Netflix. I consider data and the time we take to provide the data as investments we make and the companies give us returns on such investment through judicious choice of products to choose from. Amazon, also employs the same technique.</p>

<p>When Dirk Knemeyer complains:</p>

<blockquote>The companies that own our data use it for their own business gain and make it available to us only as it serves their corporate needs. If I asked them to provide the data to me in a format that would work in a database that I owned, they probably would not even respond to my email message or would do so only with some outrageously generic stock response that didn’t even deal with the issue. So, my data, which remains splintered and owned by corporate interests, does not serve my own personal needs for its use, preventing me from leveraging what could, in an aggregated form, represent an incredibly powerful data record that would provide an interesting tapestry of my life.</blockquote>


<p>I can see his flaw in considering these companies will provide data personally as would a mom and pop shop give you a detailed receipt or bill. Where I see Flickr as a breakthrough is companies providing APIs to harvest the investments you have with them for your gain.</p>

<p>You can already see the early adopters listing their del.icio.us links, amazon wishlists, flickr photos - everything made possible with the APIs. Even gmail provides an XML feed for your mail conversations.</p>

<p>There are several new organizing tools complementing gmail like &#8221;<a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>&#8221; which also generates ur todos and tasks in ical format enabling to outsource ur organizing needs to a seamless online platform. If and when google acquire them, gmail will become a powerful tool that would be a big threat to microsoft&#8217;s outlook.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I can visualise every online company you have investments with, providing APIs to enable authentication as well as other data as you see fit, that will replace today&#8217;s &#8220;sign up&#8221; forms, your diaries, and even your need to remember things, events and dates. The future is online.</p>
