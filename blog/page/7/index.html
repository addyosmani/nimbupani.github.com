  <div class="entry-content"><p>I often hunt for official specifications for which CSS property is supported on which version of a browser. The fastest and best source for that is <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css">Sitepoint CSS Reference</a>. But sometimes I like to verify it with the official documentation. So that I can <span class="strike">have more time to tweet</span> be more productive, here are the links to the official documentation of CSS support for all mainstream browsers.</p>


<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/">Opera</a>
    (Look for Opera Presto 2.3 for CSS features included in Opera 10.1)</li>
    <li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariCSSRef/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001267">Safari</a> (lists what is available in which version of Safari, per property. Be warned, some of those listed as &#8220;supported&#8221; are really <a href="http://nimbupani.com/redesign-of-nimbupanicom.html">not</a>).</li>
    <li>
         <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905850.aspx">IE</a> (separate list of supported CSS properties per browser version).
    </li>                                                                                                                                     
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS_Reference">Firefox</a> (lists what is available in which version of Firefox, per property)</li>
</ul>


<p>If you are looking to use an upcoming standard (like CSS3, HTML5) you can also refer to this <a href="http://a.deveria.com/caniuse/">excellent list of cross-browser support for each feature</a> or the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/compatibility.html">respected Quirksmode Compatibility Tables</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, the 3 month long redesign of nimbupani.com is complete. The design was first explored in <a href="http://nimbu.in">nimbu.in</a>, and, as you can see, I made minor changes while adapting it to this site. Here are some of the changes that you can look forward to:</p>


<h3>HTML 5</h3>


<p>This site uses HTML 5 markup and uses HTML 5 valid code (at least for the recent posts), which unfortunately means Firefox 2 users will get weird layout issues. Sorry Firefox 2 users, please <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/nimbupani">subscribe</a> or turn off styling for a better experience.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Better Reading Experience</h3>


<p>My posts on this blog have become longer and the previous design did not allow readers to read the post comfortably. The default font size is bigger, and has more contrast with the background. I have removed other distracting elements like the delicious links (which are anyway bundled with the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/nimbupani">main feed</a>) and twitter updates.</p>


<h3>Exploration of Archives</h3>


<p>There are more than 600 posts, dating from <a href="http://nimbupani.com/test.html">27th July 2003</a>, on this site. The previous design did not allow exploration of older posts (and a dysfunctional search form did not help). I am still tinkering with an efficient way of presenting the archives, but I am pleased that many people are <a href="http://twitter.com/nekessa/status/6393730779">already discovering older posts after the redesign</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Fewer Categories</h3>


<p>I was, unfortunately, one of the mindless millions who enabled tagging on their blogs just because it was &ldquo;cool&rdquo; thing to do at that time. That has brought along an excess of tags that I really did not need, so I have grouped them in to mainly these categories: Illustration, Drupal, Web Design, Book Reviews, and Others. Others is where all the rest of tags go and die. This is a work in progress, and would change depending on how people use this site.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Better Search</h3>


<p>The good news is I actually have a search form on every page that <em>works</em>. I have also enabled advanced search on the main search page. If you are interested in the books I have reviewed, now you have a better chance of finding if I have reviewed them.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Drupal 6</h3>


<p>To say it was hard to develop in Drupal 6 is an understatement. <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/design-in-open-source">Mark Boulton nails it</a>. It seems to me, the answer to design questions for Drupal developers seems to be to create another module, use SQL queries, or Drupal functions. The UX for the Site Administrator functions has remained unchanged for 6 years, and still horrible. More details coming in a post about creating HTML5 themes for Drupal 6.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Printing</h3>


<p>The last design used a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/print">ready-to-use print CSS available as a Drupal module</a>. I included a print CSS with this design and uses paged media properties which is not supported by Safari and IE 7-.</p>


<h3>Site architecture</h3>


<p>The &#8220;portfolio&#8221; that was hanging on the homepage served no purpose. So, the blog again takes the main stage. My intention is this site will remain as a collection of all my writing online.</p>


<h3>Feedback</h3>


<p>I would love to hear your opinions on the new design and experience of using nimbupani.com. You can either post them as comments here or as replies to my <a href="http://twitter/nimbuin">twitter updates</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://chaz6.com">Chris Hills</a> brought Data URIs to my attention in a <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/font-in-your-face.html#comment-3137" title="Font in your face | Nimbupani Designs">comment on my post on web fonts</a>. I had not thought about using Data URIs in CSS at all, but <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/10/27/data-uris-explained/" title="Data URIs explained | NCZOnline">others have</a>.</p>




<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">Data URIs</a> allow any file to be embedded inline within CSS. Here is an example of a Data URI:</p>

    }</code>
</pre>


<p>See <a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/datauri/index.html">how it looks</a></p>


<p>Data URIs are always of this format:</p>


<pre>
    <code>data:[&lt;mediatype&gt;][;base64],&lt;data&gt;</code>
</pre>


<p><code>mediatype</code> can be any of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Type">Content Types</a>. The Content Types most useful for CSS are:</p>


<ul>
<li>font/opentype</li>
<li>application/x-font-ttf</li>
<li>image/png</li>
<li>image/gif</li>
<li>image/jpeg</li>
<li>image/svg+xml</li></ul>


<p>Data URIs can be used in the CSS in many ways.</p>




<h3>Embedding Images in CSS</h3>


<p>Any CSS property that uses the <code>src</code> function can use Data URI scheme to embed data. This means, you can embed a CSS sprite like:</p>




<pre>
<code>.button {
    background:url(data:image/png /*embed code */)
}                                               

.button.active {
    background-position:0 -40px;
}                         

.button:hover {
    background-position: 0 -20px;   
}
</code></pre>




<p>See a <a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/datauri/index.html#sprite">demo of embedding images with data URI scheme</a></p>


<p>This only works on Firefox 2+, Opera 7.2+, Chrome, Safari, IE 8+. For earlier IE versions, you can use a <a href="http://www.phpied.com/mhtml-when-you-need-data-uris-in-ie7-and-under/" title="MHTML - when you need data: URIs in IE7 and under / Stoyan's phpied.com">MHTML workaround</a> in your IE-specific stylesheet.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Embedding Web Fonts in CSS</h3>


<p>Most browsers allow fonts to be embedded using Data URI scheme.</p>


<p>Robert Accettura wrote a great article investigating <a href="http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2009/07/03/optimizing-font-face-for-performance/">Data URLs in @font-face</a>. His demo page renders the embedded fonts correctly in Opera 10, Firefox 3.5, and Safari 4.</p>


<p></p>

<p>IE 8 (the only IE that supports data uri scheme), for security reasons, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc848897(VS.85).aspx" title="data Protocol">allows only images to be embedded inline</a>, so @font-face will not render embedded fonts.</p>


<h3>Advantages</h3>


<ul>
     <li><a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/11/16/cssembed-automatically-data-uri-ize/">Fewer HTTP requests</a>.</li>
    <li>If you are using it for @font-face implementation, you can avoid the <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/">Flash of Unstyled Text</a> since the font is inline (thanks @<a href="http://twitter.com/paul_irish">paul_irish</a>).</li>
    <li>All resources are in one place and if you cannot host images, fonts, you can embed them inline in the stylesheet (Nicholas C. Zakas has written a tool, <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/11/03/automatic-data-uri-embedding-in-css-files/">CSSEmbed</a>, that replaces image references in your CSS file as Data URIs). It would also be useful when you create <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2009/09/06/introduction-to-w3c-widgets-my-presentation-at-brighton-barcamp-4/">stand-alone web applications running as widgets</a>. </li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<h3>Drawbacks</h3>


<p><li>Large file sizes. Embedded images work best with small images like icons and arrows. Rob Flaherty has done some excellent research into <a href="http://www.ravelrumba.com/blog/css-images-and-data-uris/">real-time performance of inline embedding</a>.</li>
<li>Not easy to maintain. Any change to the image or font needs to be added correctly to the CSS.</li></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For once, I will be able to observe Thanksgiving Celebrations in the US. Scott Berkun has a great post on <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2007/debunking-thanksgiving-myths/">myths of thanksgiving</a>. I hope to spend my long weekend looking back on what I accomplished this year and creating plans for the next. Hope you all have a great long weekend!</p>




<p>Here are the books I have read since the <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/book-reviews-for-november-2009-part-1.html">last set of books</a>:</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Secret Identity: The Fetish Art of Superman&#8217;s Co-creator Joe Shuster</h3>
        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Shuster" title="Joe Shuster - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Joe Shuster</a>, the creator of Superman, hit nadir during the 50s, when he lost the Superman copyright claim law suit against DC Comics. It was during this time, comic historian  Craig Yoe says, he took to drawing fetish art for money. The art is exemplary, but a lot of it is quite violent. All fans of Joe Shuster’s art need to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810996340?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0810996340">Secret Identity: The Fetish Art of Superman&#8217;s Co-creator Joe Shuster</a>. Not surprisingly, most of these illustrations have characters similar to those from the early works of Superman. 
        </p>
    </li> 
    <li>
        <h3>Murder Can Crash Your Party</h3>
        <p>
            Please don&rsquo;t waste your time reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451223845?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0451223845">Murder Can Crash Your Party</a>. Not unless you are thirty and <em>still</em> reading Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Dying Inside</h3>
        <p>This is a great novel about what it feels like when a super-human loses his superpowers. The book details the thoughts of the protagonist as he starts losing his power of hearing what people around him think. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765322307?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0765322307">Dying Inside</a> uses science fiction as a prop to describe the melancholy of existence, and describes it really well.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Thing Around Your Neck</h3>
        <p>This is the latest book of short stories by my new favourite writer, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. A few of them, like The Thing Around Your Neck, A Private Experience, The Arrangers of Marriage, stand out. It is great to read an immigrant’s perspective on things that most of us take for granted. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307271072?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307271072">The Thing Around Your Neck</a> is a must read for every Chimamanda fanboi.</p>
    </li>

        <h3>The World of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan</h3>
        <p>I had read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1417900695?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1417900695">The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon</a> and wanted to read more about the life and times of Japan during the era when <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014243714X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=014243714X">The Tale of Genji</a> was written. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568360290?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1568360290">The World of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan</a> cites historical texts from that era to describe people, culture, religion, outlook at that time. 
        </p>              
        <p>It is shocking to see so many records that still exist from that era (around 11th Century CE). Ivan Morris says most of what was fashionable at that time came from China (including Buddhism). It is also interesting to note that men who had round features were considered handsome at that time (hence, most paintings feature people with cherubic faces). Anyone not of noble birth were as good as dead to those of higher birth. Most noblemen spent their lives near Kyoto (the capital at that time) and considered moving to outskirts as &ldquo;exile&rdquo;</p>
        <p>This book spends a lot of pages explaining how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiwara_clan" title="Fujiwara clan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Fujiwara clan</a> schemed to gain monopoly over Japan over the course of 200 years. It is also written quite formally, so it got a bit boring towards the end.</p>
    </li>                                                    
    <li>
        <h3>A Princess Remembers: The Memoirs of the Maharani of Jaipur</h3>
        <p>Gayatri Devi, for many Indians, epitomized the fairy tale reality of Maharanis. </p>
        <p>I thought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8171673074?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=8171673074">A Princess Remembers: The Memoirs of the Maharani of Jaipur</a> would be really condescending, but thankfully it is not, except for this text &ldquo;we were told to treat <abbr title="Aide-de-Camp">ADC</abbr>s with respect unlike servants.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>I found it hilarious when the authors state tiger/cheetah hunts by the royals did not lead to the extinction of those animals.</p>
        <p>I cannot share in her lament over her financial losses. I think a lot of these princely states survived <em>because</em> of the British and not in spite of them. I find the sense of entitlement that pervades this book annoying. Gayatri Devi does not reveal her real feelings about the unexpected deaths of her parents, siblings, and husband. It feels like I am reading a long interview rather than a biography.</p>   
        <p>If you are a fan of stories about Indian Kings and Queens, this book is for you. It describes, in great detail, the opulence and grandeur of the life of a Princess.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">Youtube HTML 5 demo</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/laura_carlson">Laura Carlson</a> and was amazed at their simple sprite solution for static ratings display. Here is how to create one.</p>


<h3>Caveat</h3>


<p>This solution is only for displaying a static rating and not an <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/05/half-star-rating-plugin">animated one</a>.</p>


<p>I am using the word &ldquo;star&rdquo; a bit loosely in this post. The &ldquo;star&rdquo; in the sprite below is a circle for the sake of simplicity.
<h3>Image</h3>
<p>Create a sprite as shown below. I have created each circle within an imaginary 20px box so that it is easier to style via CSS. You can use my reference <a href="/blog/demo/ratingsprite/stars.psd">Photoshop file</a> where I have used guides to position each circle at intervals of 20px.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/files/stars.png" alt="stars sprite"></p>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>Put this HTML where you want your ratings to appear:</p>
<pre>&lt;span class=&quot;rating r0&quot;&gt;0/5&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<p>The class <code>rating</code> will be used to apply all the common style properties. Classes <code>r0</code> to <code>r5</code> will be used to position the sprite as a background image appropriately.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>In your CSS file, add the following:</p>

<pre>
span.rating {
  background:url(&quot;star.png&quot;) top left;  
  display:inline-block;
  width:100px; /* width of the set of 5 stars */
  overflow:hidden;
  text-indent:-1000em;  
}                                     
</pre>

<h3>Creating the rating</h3>
<p>Now we style each of the <code>r0</code> to <code>r5</code> classes. </p>

<pre>span.r0 {
  background:-50px 0;
}</pre>               

<pre>
span.r1 {             
   background-position:-60px 0; /* assuming each star is 20px wide */      
}      
</pre>

<p>and so on&hellip;</p>

If you use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> you can add this to your SASS file:
<pre>
// 100 is the width of the set of 5 stars and 20 is the width of each 
// star (including the space to the right, see the Photoshop file

@for !i from 0 through 5
  span.r#{!i}
    background-position = &quot;#{-(100 - (20*!i))}px 0&quot; 
</pre> 

<p>Here is the <a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/ratingsprite/">demo of the star ratings sprite</a>.</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Single image, lesser page requests, faster page load.</li>
    <li>Small file size</li>
    <li>Easier maintainance: You only need to edit one image file in case you want to change the graphic.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know! November has barely begun and here I am posting my book reviews already thanks to my two-week vacation!</p>


<p>I had a great time in Chennai and Bangalore, meeting very interesting people and drinking in the new developments. It could be my hallucination, but there seems to be an abundance of opportunities here. Service providers are falling over themselves to provide creative solutions (Per second billing has arrived in India <em>without government intervention</em>, and where are we in U.S.?). This trip has definitely made me rethink where I want to be 5 years from now.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Now, here are my reviews!</p>


<ul>
    <li><h3>The Bolter</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307270149?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307270149">The Bolter</a> talks about a woman of the privileged class in the 20s, who like many of her generation, liked to experimented with drugs, sex, travel to avoid boredom. The author seems to have idolized the protagonist (her grandmother) &mdash; I guess that is usual in most biographies. It is a breezy read, and a good book to point at conservatives when they talk about morality in &ldquo;good old days&rdquo;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
   <h3>Spirit House: A Vincent Calvino Crime Novel</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802143520?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802143520">This book</a> is written for an American audience panting for the sense of exotic while really looking for the familiarity of US crime thrillers. Avoid, unless you are one of them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Portland Noir</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933354798?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1933354798">Portland Noir</a> is a collection of short stories written in the style of Raymond Chandler. It is also the first time I came across lesbian crime stories which were sensible and did not sound trite or derogatory. A good read if you like Noir.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Diary of a Social Butterfly</h3>
        <p>I was very curious about <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/diary-social-butterfly-moni-mohsin/8814000535-sd33f930nc">this book</a> as it is written as a diary of a Page 3 socialite of Pakistan. It is a collection of columns by Moni Mohsin published in Pakistan’s Friday Times (I will spare you of the pain of viewing their antique website). As a column, each chapter works really well, but as a collection in a book they appear tedious and repetitive. <a href="http://randomhouseindia.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/moni-mohsin-a-ball-less-winter/">Here is how one chapter looks like</a>. The author is very &ldquo;punny&rdquo;, lovers of the English language might enjoy it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Everyman</h3>
        <p><a href="http://twitter.com/aravindadiga/status/4615841945">Aravind Adiga</a> recommended Philip Roth, so I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/061873516X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=061873516X">Everyman</a> which is a book about death. It was an engrossing, but melancholic read. The book is quite “existential” if I may say so and I really liked it for showing no pretenses about death or life.</p>
    </li>                   
    <li>
        <h3>Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805080430?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0805080430">Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder</a> has a lot of similarities to <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/book-reviews-for-august-2009.html">The Whuffie Factor</a>, but unlike Whuffie Factor, this is actually well-written, and clear. If you are as addicted to being online as I am, nothing mentioned here is &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;. Read this book if your only online activity is facebook/gmail. </p>
    </li> 
    <li>
        <h3>Purple Hibiscus</h3>
        <p>I &ldquo;loved&rdquo; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1565123875?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1565123875">Purple Hibiscus</a>. It is beautifully written and very engrossing. I probably liked it more because I could relate to the story of Kambili (the protagonist). I am shocked that a &ldquo;debut&rdquo; novel has been written so well. It captures Nigeria and the religious divisions vividly without stereotyping or making them exotic to appeal to global audience. If there is one book you want to read this year, I would recommend this one.</p>
    </li>                                 
    <li>
        <h3>Escape</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0330464795?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0330464795">Escape</a> has an interesting premise: What if cloning replaces reproduction and women were exterminated? This story tracks the journey of a girl from a country of clones, who has never known what it is like to be a woman, to reach a country where women exist and are treated with respect. It is an interesting read, the story parallels <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Men">Children of Men</a> somewhat.</p>
    </li>                                                              
    <li><h3>Chasing the Monk’s Shadow</h3>
        <p>This is yet <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/book-reviews-for-september-2009.html">another bad travel book</a>, but it is not apparent at first. Mishi Saran travells through China but is home-sick for &ldquo;India&rdquo; in every chapter. So, Mishi Saran comes to South India and misses &ldquo;North India&rdquo;. It is amazing that she travelled almost exactly the same path taken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanzang">Xu&aacute;n Z&agrave;ng</a>, but her overly romanticized view of India is annoying. The last chapter is quite an insightful look at life under Taliban rule in Afganistan and the errors of the U.N. mission there. Despite the redeeming last chapter, I am still inclined to classify <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670058238?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0670058238">Chasing the Monk&#8217;s Shadow</a> as poor travel writing. I never feel this way reading books by William Dalrymple or Pico Iyer, but some travel books just make me squirm and this was one of them.</p>
     </li>
    <li>
        <h3>My Friend Sancho</h3>
        <p>Was quite disappointed with <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/my-friend-sancho-amit-varma/8190617311-gw23f9wlin">this novel</a>. It is probably because I had very high expectations of it.</p>
    </li>                                                                        
    <li><h3>The Writerly Life</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.flipkart.com/writerly-life-r-k-narayan/0143028995-xow3f0g72b">Writerly Life</a> is a beautiful set of essays by R. K. Narayan. Most essays are still relevant and are insights into how he crafts his writing. After reading this, I think R. K. Narayan was the embodiment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Common_Man">The Common Man</a>. This book is a must-read, irrespective of whether you like his writing or not.</p></li>
        <li>
            <h3>City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006008958X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=006008958X">City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit</a> is a  run-of-the-mill crime thriller. Another reason not to trust recommendations from people I don&rsquo;t know. A snappy read for getting through a flight journey, but not very interesting otherwise.</p>
        </li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Web Development is infinitely more troublesome when you have documents in languages other than American English. The onus is on us web developers and server administrators to make sure browsers and search engines can detect the right language. Here is how you can declare the language of your document in HTML 5.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>What is language declaration?</h3>


<p>This is a way to specify what language a HTML document or a snippet of HTML text is in. Language declaration does not provide information on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/#ri20050208.093646470">character encoding and the text direction</a> (right to left or left to right). Those need to be declared separately.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Why specify a language?</h3>


<p>Language information can be used for:</p>


<ul><li>Text to speech converters (e.g. speak Canadian french rather than french)</li>
        <li>Selecting the right fonts for display (e.g. use  traditional chinese script instead of the simplified one)</li>
        <li>Selecting the right dictionary for browser spell-checks in forms (use UK English rather than US English)</li>
        <li>Rendering the page correctly — in short deliver the document in its most natural language as possible.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Language processing</h3>


<p>In HTML 5, there are 3 ways to declare the language of a HTML document:</p>


<ul><li>As a pragma directive e.g. <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-language&quot; content=&quot;en&quot;&gt;</code></li>
    <li><p>As part of header in HTTP response, e.g. below:</p>
<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2003 10:46:04 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.28 (Unix) PHP/4.2.3
Content-Location: CSS2-REC.en.html
Vary: negotiate,accept-language,accept-charset
TCN: choice
P3P: policyref=http://www.w3.org/2001/05/P3P/p3p.xml
Cache-Control: max-age=21600

Content-Language: en            
</pre>
    <small>Example from W3C article on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/#ri20040808.101452727">Internationalization Best Practices</a></small>
    </li>
<li>As <code>lang</code> attribute on a HTML element e.g. <code>&lt;div lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;</code>, or a <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on XML documents like MathML and SVG.</li> </ul>




<p>The first two ways of specifying language is used to identify <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/#ri20040808.101452727">the intended audience</a> of the HTML document. This information is used in the following ways:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Search Engines use this for determining which document to include in search results (e.g. it will not show a document with content-language set as Chinese if a search is looking for english documents, but most search engines use more than these two to determine which documents to show).</li>
    <li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/content-negotiation.html">Content negotiation</a> by Apache servers based on the language preference set by the users on their browsers.</li> 
    <li>Identify the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#attr-lang">default language of a document</a> This concept is new in HTML 5. If you specify only one language using the above two methods (i.e.<code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-language&quot; content=&quot;en&quot;&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-language&quot; content=&quot;en, fr&quot;&gt;</code> ), then the text of the entire document is processed as that language (except for the text that is contained in an element which has a <code>lang</code> attribute, which is processed as the language tag value in <code>lang</code> attribute). </li> 
</ul>


<p>The last method is to explicitly declare a language to be used for text processing by the user agent. Use the <code>lang</code> attribute if you want the browser to process the text in that HTML element in a specific language.</p>


<p></p>

<p>The language code that comes after <code>Content-Language</code> or content in <code>meta http-equiv</code> or in <code>lang</code> attribute need to be from subtags in the IANA language subtag registry. You can read more on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/#ri20030218.131140352">choosing language values here</a></p>


<h3>Default Language of a Document</h3>


<p>Unless you explicitly use the lang attribute to define the language of the document, HTML 5 specifies the following inheritance rules to <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes">determine the language of a HTML element</a>: 
    <p>The HTML element has a <code>lang</code> attribute (e.g. <code>&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;</code>), if not &mdash;</p>
    <p>The nearest parent of that element has a lang attribute, if not &mdash;</p>  
    <p>The document has a single language tag set through pragma directive (e.g. <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-language&quot; content=&quot;en&quot;&gt;</code>), if not &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>The HTTP header Content-Language contains a single language tag, if not &mdash;</p>
    <p>The document is treated as that of an unknown language.</p>  
<h3>Bottomline</h3> 
<p>This is not the last word on detecting the language of a document, but for the time being, if your document has content that is mostly not English, use the <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element to specify the language. If there are elements of the document which use language other than the one specified for the whole document, use <code>lang</code> attribute for each such element.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am going to India soon, so I wanted to get my book reviews out before that. I had two nights of insomnia thanks to an allergy and managed to read these 5 books before the month ended. Here are my reviews:</p>


<ul>
    <li><h3>Relentless</h3>
        <p>I last read a popular thriller in 2000. I picked this book up because Stephen King cites Dean Koontz as a master of this genre. I was extremely disappointed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553807145?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553807145">Relentless</a>.</p>
        <p>There are way too many similes and metaphors in this book disguised as humor. Of course, he plays it to his audience by making snide remarks on the &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; of Wikipedia entries.</p>
        <p>This book reads like a sarcastic attempt at writing a thriller. The story is about how the protagonist (an author) tries to fend off a psychotic reviewer. The plot does sound like it requires you to leave your brain behind to read such silliness, but at times it gets too far.</p> 
        <p>It uses time tested tactics of dropping a fictional bomb at the end of every chapter to make it a real &ldquo;page turner&rdquo;. It angers me that authors need to resort to such cheap tactics to get the reader to plod on to the next chapter.</p>
        <p>So, unless you are looking for a mindless page turner to get through the torture of flying, do not read this book.</p>

   <h3>The Art of Political Murder: Who Killed the Bishop?</h3>
        <p>Central America has had a violent past and a uncertain present. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802118283?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802118283">The Art of Political Murder: Who Killed the Bishop?</a> documents the assassination of Bishop Juan Gerardi in Guatemala City in 1998. The murder seems straightforward, but 7 years of research documented in this book proves otherwise. This book exposes the corruption within the church, the rampant human rights violations in Guatemala, the power of the army, and the dishonest relationship of the U.S. Republican governments with the Guatemalan army.</p>
        <p>It is compelling to read but very depressing. The book suggests the  &ldquo;rite of passage&rdquo; for the members of the intelligence unit of the Guatemalan Army was to kill a random citizen of Guatemala. It also explains how justice never gets done in courts — witnesses, judges, lawyers, their children get murdered or they flee the country. This case has been through so many courts and several drastically different rulings because of that.</p>
        <p>The U.S. National Security Archive has declassified some information on the <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/latin_america/guatemala.html">U.S. activities in Guatemala</a> till 1993 which are not pleasant to read.</p>

        <h3>How to Travel Practically Anywhere</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618607536?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0618607536">How to Travel Practically Anywhere</a> is one of the rare books that I actually enjoyed reading, despite picking it up on a whim from the library. Susan Stellin has a great sense of humor and gives a lot of practical tips. The first chapter deals with the different kinds of travel books available &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t know about <a href="http://www.bradt-travelguides.com/">Bradt Travel Guides</a> which are guide books for rarely visited places.</p>
        <p>It also gives some practical tips on how to ask for discounts and when to ask for them. The only criticism I have is that, it is written for an American audience and the information given seems to be US and Euro-centric. Nevertheless, a good read if you are a wannabe traveller (like me!)</p>

        <h3>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</h3>
        <p>This book was released after the death of the author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieg_Larsson">Stieg Larsson</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739384155?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0739384155">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> starts with a story on illegal activities of a Swedish global corporation but ends with a gruesome murder mystery. I really enjoyed reading this book at one go. Stieg&rsquo;s life was no less interesting &mdash; he exposed several extreme right and racist organizations of Sweden and lived under death threats.</p>

        <h3>Politically Correct Bedtime Stories</h3>
        <p>This book is a hilarious take at how fairy tales would be, if they were written by politically correct authors. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/002542730X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=002542730X">Politically Correct Bedtime Stories</a> has interesting plot twists and endings for fairy tales we take for granted. It is a slim volume and very hilarious. But, I would have rather read these as a series of blog posts than as a book! It is hard to suppress laughter while reading it, so I recommend you dont&rsquo;t read it in the library.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One area in my <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/font-in-your-face.html" title="Font in your face | Nimbupani Designs">webfonts investigation</a> that I wanted to know more about, was the state of SVG fonts.</p>


<h3>What is SVG?</h3>


<p></p>

<p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG was created to fill the need for a standardized vector graphic solution for the web (read about <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Secret_Origin_of_SVG">the history of SVG</a>). SVG uses XML to describe 2D graphics. So, a circle is defined in SVG as:</p>




<pre>
    &lt;svg width=&quot;12cm&quot; height=&quot;4cm&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 1200 400&quot;
         xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;desc&gt;Example Circle&lt;/desc&gt;
      &lt;circle cx=&quot;600&quot; cy=&quot;200&quot; r=&quot;100&quot;
            fill=&quot;red&quot; stroke=&quot;none&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot;  /&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;    
</pre>




<p>See <a href="/blog/demo/svgfonts/circle.svg">the sample SVG</a>.</p>


<p>You can convert almost any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" title="Vector graphics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">vector graphic</a> to SVG format (here is <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Illustrator/14.0/WS714a382cdf7d304e7e07d0100196cbc5f-655ba.html">how to save your Adobe Illustrator files as SVG</a>). Typically, since SVG is XML (and a vector graphic), it will be smaller than other image formats.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>The elephant in the room</h3>


<p>Before I proceed, I must mention that <a href="http://www.rustybrick.com/svg-support-for-internet-explorer.html">IE (even IE 8) does not support SVG</a>. <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/info/ReleaseNotes/Default.html">IE 9 Preview does have support for SVG</a>. Google Chrome&rsquo;s native support of SVG is not as good as Opera, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/SVG_in_Firefox">Firefox</a>, or <a href="http://webkit.org/projects/svg/index.html">Safari</a> either (see <a href="http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php" title="SVG Support in major browsers">this excellent chart of SVG support on various browsers</a>). Google has released <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/">SVG Web</a> which allows SVG to be rendered on all browsers that support either SVG or Flash.</p>


<h3>Fonts in SVG</h3>


<p>Like in any vector graphic, SVG can have text. If you want the text to render a font on any SVG Viewer, you have 3 options:</p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li><p><em>Use web-safe fonts:</em> This is the easiest. An example:</p>
            <pre>&lt;text x=&quot;100&quot; y=&quot;100&quot; style=&quot;font-family: impact, georgia, times, serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal&quot;&gt;
    Text using web safe font
&lt;/text&gt;               
            </pre>   
            <p>See demo of <a href="/blog/demo/svgfonts/svg-websafe.svg">SVG rendered with web-safe font</a></p>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Use @font-face CSS declaration to specify fonts:</em> Browsers will render text just as they render HTML using @font-face. For example, Firefox does not allow cross-site linking of fonts, so it will not render a font if it is in another server (you need to add a <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/beautiful-fonts-with-font-face/" title="beautiful fonts with @font-face at hacks.mozilla.org">HTTP header to allow cross-site linking</a>). </p>
<pre>
&lt;defs&gt;
  &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
   &lt;![CDATA[
    @font-face {
        font-family: Delicious;
        src: url(&#x27;http://nimbupani.com/demo/svgfonts/delicious-roman.otf&#x27;);
    }
   ]]&gt;
 &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/defs&gt;
&lt;text x=&quot;100&quot; y=&quot;100&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &#x27;Delicious&#x27;; font-weight:normal; font-style: normal&quot;&gt;
 Text using CSS @font-face
&lt;/text&gt;   
</pre> 
<p>See a demo of <a href="/blog/demo/svgfonts/svg-fontface.svg">SVG text rendered with CSS @font-face</a></p>
</li>
<li>  
    <p>
            <em>Use fonts defined using SVG&rsquo;s font element: </em> SVG format provides a common font format that will be supported by all confirming SVG viewers. An SVG font will have a file extension of &ldquo;.svg&rdquo; and will be formatted as XML. Here are <a href="http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/751/SVGfonts_in_HTML.html">some examples of SVG fonts</a>. There are two ways of using SVG Fonts:  </p>   
<ul>
    <li><p><em>Using external SVG Fonts: </em> You can link to an external SVG using the font-face element of SVG (not the CSS @font-face declaration).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Embed font within the svg file:</em> Most Vector Graphic editors default to this option.</p></li>
</ul>           
            <p><a href="http://purl.org/NET/2008,frankbruder/article/SVGFonts-usage" title="Frank Bruder - SVG Fonts: How To">This page on SVG Fonts</a> explains exhaustively how to use SVG fonts (and how to convert fonts from other formats to SVG). It has great examples of these two methods of using SVG fonts.</p>
</li>                                   
</ul>


<h3>Using SVG Fonts for HTML</h3>


<p>Using the CSS <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/font-in-your-face.html">@font-face declaration</a>, you can also specify SVG fonts instead of just TTF/EOT/OTF fonts. It looks like only Opera 10 and Safari 4 support SVG fonts in CSS (<a href="http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/593/SVGfonts_in_HTML.html" title="Web fonts example">see a demo of SVG Fonts in HTML</a>). There is a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119490">bug filed for Firefox</a> but no fix yet.</p>


<h3>Why use SVG fonts?</h3>


<ul>                                         
    <li><em>Universal support:</em> Any conforming SVG viewer will render the text in the SVG font specified.</li>
    <li><em>Store multiple fonts in a single file:</em> You can create a single SVG file with multiple fonts and use the &#8220;id&#8221; of that specific font element to declare which font you want to use in your HTML or SVG document.</li>
    <li><em>Open Source:</em> The font file is completely open. If <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/fonts.html#MissingGlyphElement">the font you are using is missing glyphs</a> you can add the glyph you need.</li>
    <li><em>Chrome Support:</em> (Thanks for this suggestion <a href="http://twitter.com/paul_irish">@paul_irish</a>!) If you use SVG font format in CSS @font-face declaration for HTML/SVG, it will now work on the latest releases of Chrome, Safari, and Opera (though not on Firefox!).</li>   
</ul>


<h3>Disadvantages of SVG fonts</h3>


<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The main drawback to SVG fonts is there is no provision for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting">font-hinting</a>. The SVG standard states:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/fonts.html#SVGFontsOverview">
            <p>SVG fonts contain unhinted font outlines. Because of this, on many implementations there will be limitations regarding the quality and legibility of text in small font sizes. For increased quality and legibility in small font sizes, content creators may want to use an alternate font technology, such as fonts that ship with operating systems or an alternate WebFont format.</p>   
        </blockquote>                               
    </li>                                  
    <li>
<p>SVG support across browsers is still not consistent. The support for SVG fonts in HTML is even worse.</p>        
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>The Future</h3>


<p>SVG has gained a lot of traction in the recent months. Projects like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/">SVG Web</a> can only make the adoption easier. Different browsers support SVG text differently. But, as someone said, these are interesting times for SVG.</p>
