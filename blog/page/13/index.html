  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is an interesting paper that is <a href="http://redish.net/content/papers/interactions.html">a set of observations on users who work with screen readers</a>. Here are some of my notes:</p>


<ol>
<li>Screen reader users scan with their ears. I saw a video of a blind person using the screen reader, and the speed at which they set the voice is really high. Sighted users will definitely have a hard time picking up even one word.</li>
<li>Screen reader users must remember a lot of information.</li>
<li>Most of the users do not use all the features of a screen reader</li>
<li>Screen reader users must somehow decipher mispronounced words (e.g. “VA” pronounced as “va”)</li>
<li>Most screen reader users do not use text-only versions. I also have noticed several sites have a “Text Version” of their site with stale content (sometimes even dated to 1999!).</li>
<li>Many users jump from link to link or use the list box</li>
<li>Many users miss the link to skip navigation. Label it as &#8220;Skip to main content&#8221; so that the readers accent is clear.</li>
<li>The find feature does not cycle through the entire page (i.e. it searches from where the pointer is to the last character but does not go back and search from the first character) and the cursor moves as it speaks.</li>
<li>Some screen reader users jump from heading to heading.</li>
<li>If screen-reader users are in form-filling (Edit) mode, they do not hear any text that is not part of a field.</li>
<li>Screen reader users find it difficult to find the form.</li>
<li>When filling out a field makes the page refresh, the software starts reading from the top as if it were a new page.</li>
<li></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Nielsen Norman Group has made one of their reports <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/accessibility/">Beyond ALT Text: Making the Web Easy to Use for Users With Disabilities</a> free for download. It is a great reasoned report on how and what the obstacles the handicapped encounter while using the web. I recommend you to download and read the report fully.</p>


<p></p>

<p> I took some notes and here are a few extracts I found really useful as a web designer.</p>


<p>The blind use the web for:
</p>


<ol>
    <li>Emailing</li>
    <li>Researching stock trading</li>
    <li>Find recipes</li>
    <li>HAM radio signals</li>
    <li>Phone book</li>
    <li>Directions to own house</li>
    <li>Listen to radio</li>
    <li>Search for jobs</li>
    <li>Download music</li>
    <li>Participate in fan site discussions</li>
    <li>Download books on tape</li>
</ol>


<p>Also interesting to note is, more sighted users use &#8220;help&#8221; than non-sighted users</p>




<p>There are 75 best practices for designing for the handicapped users. But I found the following tips most useful for designing accessible websites:
</p>


<ol>
<li>Follow basic rules of good design.</li>
<li>Minimize the use of graphics.</li>
<li>Use ALT text to briefly describe images, and the LONGDESC attribute to thoroughly describe them. </li>
<li>Never blur pictures to indicate unavailability. Remove the picture from view (e.g. button graphics).</li>
<li>Make it easy for users to skip any multimedia and Flash demos.</li>
<li>Do not automatically create a text-only version of your site.</li>
<li>Avoid using pop-up windows. If you do use pop-up dialog boxes, make sure the default action is the most forgiving. </li>
<li>Avoid opening new browser windows. If you do open new browser windows, always provide a simple way to get back to the site’s main homepage. </li>
<li>Avoid using cascading menus.</li>
<li>Limit the number of links on a page (not more than 20).</li>
<li>Avoid very small buttons and tiny text for links. </li>
<li>Minimize the need for scrolling. </li>
<li>Limit the amount of information that forms require; collect only the minimum needed. </li>
<li>Make sure tab order is logical. Match the tab order to the visual layout when possible. </li>
<li>In forms, put any instructions pertaining to a particular field before the field, not after it. </li>
<li>Test your sites text fonts and colors with screen magnifiers.</li>
<li>Avoid using tables for aesthetic page design. </li>
<li>Especially in tables, do not use graphics to indicate a state, such as yes/no or on/off.</li>
<li>Summarize all tables (using SUMMARY attribute). </li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Visit the new <a href="http://pl.sg">Singapore Public Library website</a> first.</p>

<h3>The Good</h3>


<ol><li>The Existence of 3 different libraries is now clear. I had no idea we had 3 different kinds of libraries.</li>

<li>Elimination of the drop down menu is an excellent idea. The disappearance of bread crumbs however is not so nice. It gave me a location in the website where I was in any page. </li>

<li>Didn&#8217;t even know the existence of GoLibrary, but now thanks to the effective left navigation pane, I know about it and can even go to events listed there (<a>this event</a> is especially appealing). </li>

<li>Very glad to have the <a href="http://pl.sg/page/PlSimpleHomepage">Simple Homepage</a>. Yay!</li></ol>




<h3>The Bad</h3>




<ol><li>Not sure where I am in the site (no &#8220;active&#8221; links to show where I am now on a page). Even when I click on one of the top 4 main navs (e.g. &#8220;Just Ask&#8221;)</li>

<li>Good idea to put the feeds and blogs in the main nav. But <a href="http://pl.sg/page/PlMicrositeContent/rss">feeds list</a> is not showing the links to the actual blogs/pages. I would like to see the content of each blog/page so that I know if I would like to subscribe to them or not. </li>

<li>Just share is a new feature and it is not highlighted. Rather it could be marked with a &#8220;new&#8221; so that people know that it is a new feature and take steps to find out about it. </li>

<li>Titles for <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5s37f6">NLB Blogs list</a> do not link to the blogs themselves. Only the image on the left does. I think people are most likely to click the text themselves rather than the image on the left (which frankly looks more like a bullet point than a representative icon of that blog). Even the link URL itself is not SEO friendly nor memorable (or intuitive). </li>

<li>The blog <a href="http://blogs.nlb.gov.sg/epcl/">library@esplanade</a> is listing a downloadable link with the list of new arrivals, but would it not be better to integrate it with the existing list of arrivals for the entire Public Library (in a HTML page)? As a user, I dont want to download and then look for items to borrow. I would rather do it in one shot. </li>

<li>Each page is titled Public Library, Singapore. That just simply sucks. With 4 tabs open all I can see is &#8220;Public Library, Singapore&#8221; on all tabs, and dont know which page I am exactly on! Again, really bad for SEO too!</li>

<li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/54v4yj">JUST BROWSE</a> - the very phrase brings up an image of a catalog to browse. But apparently it is supposed to hold any info about the library and stands for &#8220;browsing the site&#8221; rather than &#8220;browing the catalog&#8221;. Since it is a library site, everyone is bound to consider the later than &#8220;browsing the site&#8221;. </li>

<li>The submit button for logging in to check your account at the <a href="http://pl.sg/page/PlSimpleHomepage">simple home page</a> is woefully small. If there are elder users to the site, they will definitely have a hard time figuring out where the submit button is and <em>actually</em> clicking it. </li>
</ol>




<h3>The Ugly</h3>


<ol><li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/5buqqu">No compliance to standards!</a> The site fails validation for HTML 4.01 Strict.</li>

<li>No accessibility for blind or handicapped users. I doubt if it even passes Singapore&#8217;s own accessibility standards as laid out in WIS guidelines. For a start, none of the links in the main nav and side nav have any alternate attribute set. It does not even pass the A level accessibility compliance based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a> (type in &#8220;http://pl.sg&#8221; <a href="http://www.tawdis.net/taw3/cms/en">here</a> and check for A level compliance). That is a big FAIL for any public service website. What is &#8220;public service&#8221; if it is not accessible to a percentage of the population (however small)? </li></ol>


<p>On the whole, I find the redesign a step in the right direction and given the huge amount of data that must have been ported, it must have been a humongous task. But it is woefully lacking in some basic standards that any public service website should pass at the minimum.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The front page has gone through a mini two-day redesign. The interesting thing about the redesign is that I went through with it after consulting my google clicks overlay map and other statistics that Google Analytics provides.</p>

<p>Most people almost never clicked on my artworks, so out it goes. Also the contact form served only as a honeypot for all spammers, so it disappears as well. My old anti-spam measure is back in, till I figure out a more effective contact form.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, kind folks at <a href="http://www.blogdesignblog.com/">Blog Design Blog</a> and <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/">sixrevisions</a> have respectively listed my websites under <a href="http://www.blogdesignblog.com/blog-design/30-comment-designs-for-webdesigners/ ">30 Must See Comment Designs for Web Designers</a> and <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/design-inspiration/bright_colorful_web_designs">35 Beautiful Bright, Colorful Web Designs</a>. A big hug and thanks for both of them!</p>

<p>I also started a <a href="http://nimbupani.etsy.com">store at Etsy</a>. Right now only my Koi Painting is for sale, but hoping to add more items within the next two months.</p>

<p>Whew! My GTD training is finally bearing fruit. This is the shortest and intensive redesign I have done ever!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://inspiredology.com/web-design/webs-brilliant-blues/">Inspiredology</a> has also linked to Nimbupani Designs as one of the websites &#8220;that I thought expressed and used the colour blue in an attractive interesting way to convey their message and/or feel of their brand&#8221; Thanks n Hugs!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.moe.edu.sg">Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE) has got a slick new look</a> - and proved that government websites and aesthetic usable designs, CAN go hand in hand. MoE&#8217;s redesign now reminds me of how a government service should be: &#8220;Integrity. Service. Excellence.&#8221; (Singapore Government&#8217;s slogan). To know how bad (or good) a government website can be, lets compare it with the <a href="http://www.mica.gov.sg/">website of the Ministry of Information, Communication &amp; the Arts (MICA)</a></p>

<p>Here is how they both look &#8220;above the fold&#8221;:
<img src="/blog/blog/files/moevsmica.gif" alt="MOE Vs. MICA websites" /></p>

<p>Clearly, the use of subtle cues in the <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr>&#8217;s redesign draws the user to the central changing content about what is the latest news in MOE. Other subtle use of colors enable the user to find links when required.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr> also uses microformats for the organizational structure which is quite neat. I think MOE website must be the first government website to validate <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=www.moe.edu.sg&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0">XHTML 1.0 Strict</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=www.moe.edu.sg&profile=css21&usermedium=all&warning=1&lang=en">CSS</a>. Did I mention it is eminently accessible without any spacer.gifs?</p>

<p>A look at the footers of <abbr title="Ministry of Information, Communication &amp; the Arts">MICA</abbr> and <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr> reveal that due thinking has gone into that as well in the <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr> website:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/blog/files/moevsmicafooter.gif" alt="MOE Vs. MICA website footers" /></p>

<p>However, there are a few things I would like in the new website:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        It is not clear which category or type the current page belongs to. Perhaps the menu item can be highlighted if it any of its child links are clicked.
    </li>
    <li>
        Breadcrumbs seem to be text only. It would be great if they are links too. 
    </li>
</ol>


<p>I think it is best that it is not incorporating the traditional system of a simple &#8220;poll&#8221; (found in all Singapore government websites) which is not enough to measure the quality of any website.</p>

<p>Overall, I think it is a great step forward for Singapore government websites. Of course, I think some small changes might be needed from the perspective of usability but that is just to make the already enhanced experience even better! Way to go <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am reading the first three chapters (<a href="http://www.wethinkthebook.net/home.aspx">available online as PDFs</a>) from <a href="http://www.wethinkthebook.net/home.aspx">We Think</a>, a book that &#8220;explores how the web is changing our world, creating a culture in which more people than ever can participate, share and collaborate, ideas and information&#8221;. </p>


<p>The first 2 chapters are very interesting, not the least for the depth of their research, but also for interesting quotes and incidents of &#8220;Open Source&#8221; and &#8220;Community&#8221; culture that was prevalent long before Web 2.0 and social networking became commonplace jargon.</p>


<p>There is a very thought-provoking example of open source design: The Cornish Engine - which proved to be superior to the patented engine developed by James Watt and Mathew Boulton. Here is an excerpt about its development from Chapter Two:</p>


<blockquote><p>In 1769 the inventor James Watt came up with a engine design which incorporated a separate condenser that cut the amount of coal needed by two thirds. This transformed the economics of mining. The Watt engine, marketed with his business partner Mathew Boulton, quickly spread through Cornish mines but [Nuvoulari papers&#8230;] the mine owners became disenchanted. Boulton and Watt charged mine owners a royalty fee equivalent to a third of the amount of money that a mine saved each year after installing their engine, the design of which was protected by a very broad patent enforced ferociously. Mine owners soon started to complain. The patent meant they could not improve on the design through their own efforts. Boulton and Watt had no incentive to make further improvements because they were making so such money. In 1790 Cornish mine owners revolted. Today they would be denounced as software pirates: they started to install unauthorised versions of the engine. Boulton and Watt took them to court and got their patent’s life-span extended to 1800. Innovation ground to a halt. Boulton and Watt never made another sale in Cornwall. </p>
<p>In 1811, a group of mine captains – lead by Joel Lean a respected local engineer – started a journal to share new ideas in the spirit of collaboration and open competition that often marks creative communities. Lean’s Engine Reporter was published each month for almost a century, reporting on all aspects of engine design. A year after the Reporter started, Richard Trevithick and Arthur Woolf introduced a new design that fast became the industry’s standard operating system. Woolf and Trevithick did not patent their design and freely allowed other mines to copy from the original erected at the Wheal Prosper mine. They made their money installing, adapting and improving engines. The tightly knit community of Cornish engineers were soon swapping ideas through the Lean Reporter for how to improve on the basic idea.</p></blockquote>


<p>I am still in the second chapter, but am very excited by the ideas the book is bringing to fore. The author claims &#8220;The social approach to creativity the web is encouraging is reviving one of the oldest forms of creativity – folk – by empowering a mass of amateurs to create and share content&hellip;simply bringing back to life an older, folk culture, which was extinguished by the mass produced, industrial culture of the record and film industry of the 20th century&#8221; I subscribe to that view too. The surging interest in self-sustained living, travel, etc., is only completing the cycle of industrialization.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I am definitely reading this book when it gets out in Singapore!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been catching up on a lot of books lately, all thanks to <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>. It was tedious at first but I am now loving it! I am mad about anything written in the 50s or earlier and many of them are available free.</p>

<p>If you love books too, go here for a <a href="http://www.friedbeef.com/2007/04/09/best-places-to-get-free-books-the-ultimate-guide/">great list of websites to search and download free books from</a> (in case <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is not enough!).</p>

<h3>Download</h3>


<p>If you are interested in downloading books in a format you prefer, you should look at <a href="http://manybooks.net/">ManyBooks.net</a>. Awesomely, you can get the books not just in PDFs but in dozens of other formats including for Kindle, iPhone, or other ebook readers.</p>

<h3>What to Read</h3>


<p>Most Indians grow up with British authors and tend to end up liking british writing enormously - I am no different. I love reading all the age old British writers: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/w#a783">Wodehouse</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/c#a80">G K Chesterton</a> (my favourite!), <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/p#a481">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/c#a451">Agatha Christie</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/d#a69">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/w#a30"> H G Wells</a>.</p>

<p>I love science fiction as well, and Project Gutenberg has a great vintage <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_(Bookshelf)">Science Fiction Book Shelf</a>. If you love Maths, read <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97">Flatland: a romance of many dimensions</a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Internet Archive&#8217;s Blog has an <a href="http://internetarchive.wordpress.com/category/cool-books/">awesome list of free e-books</a> (for children as well!). Check it out!</p>

<p>Please do leave your recommendations in the comments!</p>
