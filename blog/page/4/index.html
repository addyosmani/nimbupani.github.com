  <div class="entry-content"><p>What should be the aims of a web conference?</p>


<p>I think it should be to:</p>


<ul><li>Provide discussion of interesting perspectives</li>
<li>Challenge existing perceptions</li>
<li>Bring diverse set of people together</li>
<li>Inform the audience on current developments and challenges.</li></ul>




<p>These are not met when conferences keep inviting the same people to talk on the same niches in technology, e.g. &#8220;Form Design&#8221;, &#8220;Bulletproof Design&#8221;, &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;, &#8220;Progressive Enhancement&#8221; (and those who even use the same slides)! Granted, those niches are not &#8220;done&#8221; and there is lot to learn, but there is a lot of navel gazing when speakers tackle the same questions and problems.</p>


<p>I assert some of this stems from the fact that almost all speakers are from countries that have similar cultures, access to internet, and language (US/UK/AU). The problems/challenges that they deal with, are also those that occur within that cultural context. Consequently, the solutions they suggest (while they do their best to be unbiased) do not take into account challenges outside these countries.</p>




<p>I find that disturbing and sad that conference involve <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2009/speakers.html">only</a> <a href="http://jsconf.us/2010/speakers.html" title="speakers">speakers</a> <a href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/speakers/">who</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/dublin-2010/speakers/">reside</a> <a href="http://webdesignworld.com/2009/seattle/speakers.aspx">in</a> those countries. The majority of online users, though, happen to <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/">live elsewhere</a>. If Web conferences are supposed to be representative of the online world, then, the representation is certainly skewed.</p>




<p>Most designers/developers overseas face additional challenges while working on the web. Most countries (unlike US/UK/AU) are diverse in the number of languages spoken and cultures that exist. How do they design around that? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Unwritten_language">Some languages do not even have written scripts</a>, how do they work with that? What are some of the design decisions that they take when the written script is right-to-left or top-to-bottom?</p>




<p>Many of these countries also have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China">severe censorship</a>, how do they get around that? Some of them do not have assured source of power or might not have enough bandwidth to download even 500MB file. How do they deal with that?</p>




<p>Several people in US/UK seem to think that the &#8220;Rest of the World&#8221; will &#8220;catch up&#8221;. But there is nothing to &#8220;catch up&#8221; to, each group of people will use the internet in their own unique ways. Learning about those will definitely impact how we (US/UK/AU) look at website design and development.</p>




<p>I do agree it is difficult to know who to ask to speak. Probably, speaking to editors at <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/">Global Voices</a> would be a good place to start from. Opera, Mozilla, and W3C have also taken initiatives or organize conferences/workshops in Asia. South Africa has its <a href="http://www.tech4africa.com/speakers">Tech4Africa</a> conference. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/africas-booming-tech-space-will-define-the-continents-future/article1563090/">TMS Ruge</a> makes the case for why African countries should be counted in the technology space (<a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/4387">he also spoke at SXSW</a>).</p>


<p>And yes, I do speak from my experience of being one of the unseen and unheard. Living in the US, I am acutely aware of how ignorant most people are about how the rest of the world lives (surprisingly, the reverse is not true). The ignorance sometimes translates to disrespect or foolhardy choices. I would at least hope that for a platform as non-stereotypical as the web, we should try to mitigate it, since the websites/applications we design and develop are accessed by people from all over the world. The more we learn about the world outside our comfort zone, the better informed our design and development will be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been long <a href="http://nimbupani.com/how-to-live-in-world-without-god.html#comment-2720">recommended that I read God Delusion</a> given my disbelief in organized religion, thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/ensaar">Bharat Shetty</a>, I finally did.</p>




<p>First, the book sets out to convince believers of the futility of their beliefs by way of logic. I think the book is setup for failure because of this. But, still, the book did have a few points of note:</p>




<ol>
    <li>Belief has as much impact as falling in love - Both cannot be explained, but have to be experienced. A lot of people consider religious experience &#8220;miraculous&#8221; and hence proof that God exists. Some people even have specific Gods speaking to them (when the God asks them to do something immoral, we call <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/8660012.stm">these people schizophrenic</a>) or find evidence in God&rsquo;s actions through all the positive events in their life. Interestingly, like love, there seems to be only one God you can love at a time (even though the modern society approves of affection for multiple siblings, parents, grandparents, children, it does not allow love and affection for multiple partners). 
    </li>
    <li>Belief has caused more misery than the absence of it. Violence has always been committed between people of opposing beliefs. </li>
    <li>Believers are not rational in their belief. They might use rational explanations to convert someone else to their point of view, but inherently a belief is never rational only something &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;experiential&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Scriptures are not sources of morality. Every holy book has incidents that sound disgusting, grotesque and fail even as allegory or tales to draw morals from. This is true for any holy book that has been handed down over 1000s of years. We have all been <a href="http://nimbupani.com/mortality-of-morality.html">meandering towards more liberal moral rules</a> and these scriptures written/spoken in an age when it was not so liberal, fail to guide people in today&#8217;s world. This goes to show, our morals are not drawn from history but from the present. Religion is not a basis for morality. </li>
    <li>If not for religion, the next equivalent belief is patriotism. They both have similar basis (or absence of basis) and in several countries, one could be mistaken for the other. It only goes to show, if not for religion, the mind is capable of building other artificial constructs, so even in a hypothetical world of only atheists, we are likely to still have violence thanks to such constructs.</li> 
    <li>All religions have myths and incidents that are hard to prove, or are uncertain. Dawkins quotes a fascinating cult that grew around someone called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frum">John Frum</a>, and yet, despite its recent origin, there is no certainty that he even existed.</li> 
    <li>Culture, art, aesthetics grew with religion (it is true for most religions I know of), but is not necessary for religion to exist for that. Though, religion does impose interesting restrictions (e.g. the ban on using human faces in Islamic art).</li>  
</ol>




<p>I think this book is a good read for atheists, and agnostics who would like to understand why people are religious. But, the book falls vastly short of its goal of converting believers into non-believers, mainly because:</p>


<ol>
    <li><em>Belief is not rational</em>, Dawkins glosses over this by stating you &#8220;should&#8221; be rational about your belief. But that gets us nowhere. 
    </li>
    <li><em>Humans love status quo.</em> They do not bother about religion unless something drastically happens to make them question their beliefs. Most people are happy to exist with as little curiosity as possible. People born into a religion, continue to believe in one. 
    </li>  
    <li><em>You need social support structure.</em> It is easier to be a non-believer in places where you need little or no support from family (e.g. cities). If you depend on family/friends for support, it is almost unthinkable to question your belief for fear of losing the support.
    </li>
</ol>




<p>It also does not help that Dawkins asserts that it is &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; to not believe in God. I think there is nothing &#8220;enlightening&#8221; about it, it is just a matter of not believing something without evidence. That does not give atheists the right to act, just like most fundamentalist believers, that they are special.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I also think the question &ldquo;Does God Exist?&rdquo; is immaterial to the way we live or how we live. Blaming uncertainty or events that are beyond our understanding on an imaginary being, is simply a coping mechanism at worst, and morally, should not frame our relationship to other people.</p>


<p></p>

<p>This would have been a much better book if he had covered the culture and way of life that encourages religion (and vice versa) among major religions (here is a paper on why <a href="http://www.rovingbandit.com/2010/05/why-is-america-so-much-more-religious.html">Europe is less religious than the American continent</a>). I think it is primarily the way of life that people of a religion follow that has most impact on their beliefs rather than logical, rational thought. Most religions make it really hard to get out of those cultural habits, and think about a life without religion.</p>




<p>I really like this anecdote he quotes: </p>




<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; the great twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once asked a friend, &ldquo;why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the Earth rather than that the Earth was rotating?&rdquo; His friend replied, &ldquo;Well, obviously because it just <em>looks</em> as though the Sun is going round the Earth.&rdquo; Wittgenstein responded, &ldquo;Well, what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>




<p>I think this quote can as easily be applied to the question of god.</p>


<p></p>

<p>But, I do think this is an essential book. Just like religions need extremists to propagate, atheism or even absence of belief needs people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens">Hitchens</a> to bring attention to the existence of an alternative to religion, even though I do not approve of their shrill voices against the religious and claims of emancipating the believers. It is unfortunate, but silence is rarely heard. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, apparently I have been sleeping while all designers worth their salt have been diving into JavaScript like it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">2012</a>. While I have been a very early evangelist of jQuery, I knew only enough to get me a solution but nothing in depth of whats, ifs, and whys of JavsScript. So, a month ago, I decided to spend a Saturday watching the <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/watch/111593/1710507">JavaScript, the programming language lectures by Douglas Crockford</a>. If you are in the same boat as I am and want to be able to write JavaScript (or even if you are using jQuery or other frameworks), this will be the best 6 hours you will spend.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>




<p>You need to know the jargon of a programming language (not HTML), e.g. type, objects, arrays, etc. I think you might have a hard time understanding JavaScript if you are used to Java, or PHP. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t remember my life as a programmer, so it made understanding the lectures easy.</p>




<p>The lectures are actually only 1.5 hours long. I mentioned 6 hours because, I (thanks to prodding from <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a>) paused the video every minute to try out what Douglas was talking about on Firebug Console, and trying out other &#8220;what-if&#8221; cases that he did not mention.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Are you ready?</h3>




<p>These notes might sound a lot like the <a href="http://neverseenlost.wordpress.com/">description of Lost by someone who has never seen it</a>, which means, it might at least be entertaining. From what I have learnt, it seems <a href="http://nimbupani.com/dom-ecmascript-and-other-puzzles.html">JavaScript</a> is an irrational language much like you and me, which causes much grief to programmers.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Without further ado, here are my notes on JavaScript:</p>




<ol>
    <li>There is only one type for a number, and that is a double.</li>
    <li>There is only one String type, and does not have a type of Char like some other languages (Java)</li>
    <li><code>Math.floor()</code> and <code>parseInt()</code> do almost the same thing, which is to return an integer value based on what gets passed into them, but <code>Math.floor("10f")</code> returns <code>NaN</code> (&#8220;Not a Number&#8221;) but <code>parseInt("10f")</code> will return <code>10</code>.</li>    
    <li>JavaScript Strings are UCS-2 encoded which is almost all of UTF-8 (but excludes some new characters, and something called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ew7hbz7k(VS.71).aspx">surrogate pairs</a>).
    </li>
    <li>JavaScript has many &#8220;unknown&#8221; values: <code>NaN</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>. </li>
    <li><code>NaN</code> cannot be compared with or equated to. E.g. the comparison <code>NaN === NaN</code> evaluatesto <code>false</code>. </li>  
    <li><code>null</code> is an object (one of the schizophrenic aspects of JavaScript).
    </li>     
    <li><code>undefined</code> is the default value of any variable that has not yet been assigned a value (as you would have realised when you bang your keyboard in frustration at &#8220;Object undefined&#8221; errors).
    </li>                                               
    <li>Setting any variable to <code>undefined</code> is equivalent to deleting it.</li>
    <li>JavaScript statements can be &#8220;truthy&#8221; or &#8220;falsy&#8221;</li>
    <li>&#8220;falsy&#8221; statements are those that evaluate to <code>null</code>/<code>undefined</code>/<code>NaN</code>/<code>""</code>/<code>false</code> (bool)/<code>0</code> (int)
    </li>                               
    <li>Rest of the statements are true including those that evaluate to <code>"0"</code> (string)/ <code>"false"</code> (string).
    </li>
    <li><p>The easiest way to convert a string to number is to put a &#8220;+&#8221; (unary operator) before it. E.g.</p> 
<pre><code>a = +"42" 
b = a + 5 // b = 47

a = "42"
b = a + 5 // b = 425
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><p>The comparison operators <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> are different. <code>==</code> can do type coercion which means if the two values being compared are of different types (e.g. String and Int), it can convert one to the other (I am not clear on what gets converted to what), and compare the values. <code>===</code> does not do that. E.g.</p>
    <pre><code>43 == "43" // evaluates to true
43 === "43" // evaluates to false</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>!</code> returns boolean true, if the associated expression is falsy. e.g.</p> <pre><code>(!(43 === "43")) // true</code></pre> 
    </li>                   
    <li><p><code>!!</code> returns the boolean equivalent of the truthy/falsy nature of the expression associated with it. e.g.</p> <pre><code>!!(43 === "43") // false</code></pre> 
    <p>So, in this way, even if your expression evaluates to <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code> or <code>NaN</code>, you can use this operator to only use the boolean equivalent than these unknown values.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Switch statements use &#8220;===&#8221; comparison 
    </li>                                    
    <li>Declare a variable with <code>var</code> before it (e.g. <code>var variablename</code>), so that its scope is local to where it was declared. Otherwise the variable will be available globally (and susceptible to accidental modifications)</li>  
    <li>A variable declared in a function is available throughout the function and not just within blocks (e.g. a variable declared in if/switch statements of a function is also available for other operations in the same function).
    </li>                                                                    
    <li><p>You can define a function in two ways:</p>
        <pre><code>1. var a = function() {} 
2. var a = new function() {} 
</code></pre>
        <p>#1 implies the function returns undefined value unless there is a return statement.</p>
        <p>#2 implies the function returns an object if there is no return statement (so it acts as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)">constructor</a>).</p>        
    </li>              
    <li>An object contains &#8220;name: value&#8221; pairs, the value can be another object. The value is referred using <code>object.name</code> or <code>object[name]</code>. The name can contain any character but, if you use a name like <code>sd#</code> you cannot refer to its value in this manner <code>a.sd#</code> you can only use <code>a["sd#"]</code> </li>                                                                         
    <li><p>Objects are passed by reference, so they cannot be compared to check if they contain same name/value pairs. E.g. </p>
<pre><code>a = {b:1, c:2};
p = {b:1, c:2};

a == p; // false

p = a;  // name: value pairs of p lost, p points to a

 a == p; // true</code>
</pre>
    <p>So, when you compare two objects, you really are comparing if they are both pointing to the same location.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Arrays inherit from Objects but have additional properties and functions.</li>
    <li>Array length property returns the largest integer index + 1 e.g:
<pre><code>a[0] = "bobo"; 
a[5] = "dada"; 
console.log(a.length); // results in 6 not 2
</code></pre>       
</li>
<li><p>Arrays can have functions too: </p>
<pre><code>var a = [0, 1, 2];
a.functioname = function() {}       
</code>
</pre>
    </li>      
    <li>
<p>If you delete an item from an array, it does not alter the length of the array.</p>      
    </li>   
    <li>
<code>typeOf(variableName)</code> returns Object as the type for an array (so you cannot confirm if that variable points to an array), use <code>variableName.constructor === Array</code> to check if the variable is an array.        
    </li>
</ol>


<p></p>

<p>I am pretty sure I must have passed out at this stage after all this knowledge gain. Nevertheless, I am very curious about JavaScript and hoping to learn more from the <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/watch/111585/1027823">messiah</a>. </p>


<p>P.S. I am sorry if it was not as entertaining as the Never Seen Lost blog posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favourite past times is opening up a random email from the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">CSS mailing list</a> and going down a rabbit hole. On one rainy day, I found myself staring at the specifications for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-namespace/#intro">CSS Namespaces module</a>. </p>


<p></p>

<h3>Namespaces</h3>




<p>As Wikipedia defines it, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace">namespace</a> provides a list of uniquely identifiable elements and attributes in an XML document. Here is how you would define the namespace of an XHTML document:</p>




<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;</code></pre>




<p>The URL in the code above is simply the name of that namespace and does not refer to an actual location online. Browsers do not use or process URL. It is just an easy way to understand what that namespace is referring to when someone is reading the source code of the document. </p>




<h3>CSS Namespaces</h3>


<p>In 2007, Bert Bos <a href="http://xhtml.com/en/css/conversation-with-css-3-team/">explained why CSS Namespaces were introduced</a>:

<blockquote><p>The Namespaces module is very small, very simple, and probably rarely needed, but just because it is simple, it doesn&#8217;t cost much to add it to CSS. Indeed, many browsers have supported it for a long time already.</p>

<p>The only thing it defines is how to declare an XML Namespace prefix in CSS. That is needed if you want to use selectors that only match elements in a certain namespace. </p></blockquote>

<p>For example, SVG shares some common elements (e.g. <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html#PropertiesFromCSS2">CSS properties</a> with HTML with XML and HTML. If you are using the same stylesheet for both HTML and SVG documents, then it is best to separate out the styles for SVG and HTML to prevent any overlap.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Declare your XHTML doctype and define a namespace:</p>

<h3>Using it with HTML 5</h3>
<p><a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/html5-parser-improvements/">HTML5 allows inline SVG and MathML</a>, which means you can style HTML, inline SVG and MathML elements using the same stylesheet.</p>
    
    
<p>The advantage of HTML5 parsing is that, HTML5 parsers should <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML#Syntax_and_Parsing">implicitly assign namespaces to known vocabularies (so far SVG, XML, and MathML)</a>, if the document is <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML">HTML</a> (and <em>not</em> XHTML). This means, you do not have to use <code>xmlns</code> to explicitly specify the namespace for SVG or MathML elements in your HTML5 document.</p>

<p>The bad news is, only <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox nightly builds</a> with <code>html5.enabled = true</code> set on <code>about:config</code> parse and recognize inline SVG or MathML.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/namespaces/index.html">demo of using CSS Namespaces for a HTML5 page with inline SVG</a> (mind you, it only works on Firefox nightlies with html5 parser enabled). If you are one of the 99.9% of the population that does not use Firefox nightlies, this is how it is supposed to look:</p>

<p><img src="http://nimbupani.com/files/css3namespace-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of css3 namespaces demo"></p>
<p>The dinosaur on the left is an inline SVG image which uses styles defined in the SVG namespace. <p>

<p>As the spec mentions, it is not often you will find use for it.     Though,  <a href="http://www.iecss.com/firefox-3.6.3.css">Firefox user agent style sheet</a> uses namespaces to separate the default styles for web pages from those for Firefox UI (which uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">XUL</a>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am surprised I managed to read five books after <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-reviews-for-mar-2010.html">last month&rsquo;s poor showing</a>. I should probably have a lot more to review next month, given all the downtime I have thanks to travel. Onward with the reviews!</p>




<h3>300</h3>




<p>After Sin City, I had great expectations of a Frank Miller adaptation, but unfortunately, 300, the film, was a disappointment. I was so sure that it was the fault of the movie makers and not the book itself, that I borrowed it just to feel smug in my point of view. Sadly, I was proven wrong. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1569714029?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1569714029">300</a> sucks.</p>




<h3>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</h3>




<p>I did not know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_American_Life">This American Life</a> before I moved to Seattle, so, it is not that embarrassing to admit I did not know about David Sedaris before I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316010790?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316010790">Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</a>  in the &ldquo;Staff Picks&rdquo; of Seattle Library.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Every story reminds me of the narratives from <a href="http://waiterrant.net/?m=200404">Waiter Rant</a> (if you have never read Waiter Rant, be prepared to spend the next 5 hours reading it). I loved &ldquo;The End of the Affair&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fqvBhAnys">audio version</a>) the best (probably because it resonates so well).</p>




<h3>If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!</h3>




<p>I did the Landmark Forum sometime ago, and this book is like a word-for-word description of what goes on there or in any self-help seminars - except the author is actually a psychotherapist instead of a &ldquo;life coach&rdquo; and describes his work with sexual offenders.</p>




<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553278320?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553278320">If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!</a> is a great insight into what happens to a psychotherapist as he treats people for their mental illnesses (yes it affects him too). Unfortunately, this book is dated (Sheldon Kopp considers homosexuality, a &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo;), but a good read on how psychotherapists try to resolve issues for their patients.</p>




<h3>The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Volume 10</h3>


<p>Yet another random pick from the Graphic Novel bookshelf. Thankfully, it is awesome. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595824464?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1595824464">The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Volume 10</a> has everything to do with corpses turning into clones, robots, zombies, and every other absurdity imaginable. Must read, if you like absurd manga.</p>




<h3>Infidel</h3>




<p>This book has caused the author, Ayaan Hirsi Ali to go into hiding. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743289692?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743289692">Infidel</a> is not a simple put down of Islam but an examination of questions that grip a progressive follower of Islam. I did get a few goose-bumps when she described her genital mutilation, and how resigned Somalian women were to their fate. Her descriptions of assimilating into Dutch culture <a href="http://nimbupani.com/decade-in-review.html">mirrored my own experiences of doing so in Singapore</a>. </p>




<p>I am sure this book is biased (after all it is an autobiography), but no where does she condemn Islam for anything other than the practices followed by the hard-liners.</p>




<p>And so it ends! Any books you read last month that you recommend?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://html5readiness.com">HTML5 Readiness</a> now shows how HTML5 support has evolved since 2008. Click away to see the spurt of growth in 2010!</p>




<p><a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> pinged me on Thursday evening wondering about visualizing browser support per HTML5/CSS3 feature for <a href="http://jsconf.us/2010/schedule.html">his presentation at JSConf</a> on April 17th. I thought it would be a fun exercise in creating it with the &#8220;cool&#8221; features of CSS3. Soon, Paul had registered the domain and <a href="http://html5readiness.com">HTML5 Readiness</a> was born. Here are some of the design and implementation notes from that process.</p>




<h3>Design</h3>




<p>The intention of the visualization is to show how much support exists for each new HTML/CSS feature. I remembered the graphic showing the <a href="http://www.good.is/post/transparency-america-s-wealthiest-religions">distribution of wealth among religious Americans</a> and I thought a similar structure would work for this one too and I really liked this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eriknitsche/476093355/in/set-72157600143976187/">ad for General Dynamics by Erik Nitsche</a>.</p>




<p>Paul wanted to show support for 8 browsers (IE 7, 8, 9, Opera 10.10, Safari 4, Chrome 4, Firefox 3.5, and Firefox 3.7). The browsers are grouped into color schemes based on their underlying rendering engine - e.g. all Firefox versions are shades of blue, Chrome/Safari - yellow, IE - pink. Each ray also has a different background color if it is a CSS3 feature.</p>




<p>Each browser is represented with a tile on the bar and gets an equal width of space, so if you see a bar that is full, that means that feature has universal support among all the 8 browsers.</p>




<p><img src="http://nimbupani.com/files/html5readiness.png" alt="html5readiness.png" border="0" width="600" height="612" ></p>




<h3>Sass to rescue</h3>




<p>There was not enough time to spend working on a photoshop mockup and then implementing the design. I am also more comfortable working on a design in the browser (with all the CSS3 bells & whistles), so I dived in to HTML/Sass. <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> is a life-saver. The transforms (for each ray on the semi-circle), which result in about 114 lines of CSS (when compacted and with vendor-prefixes), are actually a result of just 4 lines of Sass:</p>




<pre><code>@for $i from 1 through 28
 .ray-#{$i}
   +transform((-6.7deg*($i - 1)), 0%, 50%)
  
  i
    +transform((6.7deg*($i - 1)), 50%, 50%)</code></pre>




<p>The odd angle multiplier (6.7) is because each ray (except the first) is transformed so that they fit into the 180 degree arc with equal angular space between each (0, 50% sets the axis for rotation). You can see <a href="http://github.com/paulirish/html5readiness.com/blob/master/src/style.sass">the full Sass file on Github</a>.<p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Most of the work was done Thursday night / Friday morning. It was great fun dealing with 2D graphics after 8 years, and I loved working on it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>    &lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of being the &lt;a href="http://nimbupani.com/font-in-your-face.html"&gt;ferret for jargon I don't understand&lt;/a&gt;, I went on a quest to understand what the phrase "Content Models" mean. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;WTF are "Content Models"?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will regret asking that question, as it is a rabbit hole. But fear not as this post can be your summary of the excitement that awaits you. In short, Content Models are used to define the kind of content that can be found within an element in HTML. Historically, this is defined in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition"&gt;DTD&lt;/a&gt; for a SGML-derived language (like XML and HTML 4.01).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;The Story so Far&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In HTML 4.01 specification, every element needs to be defined and contain a content model. For example, a &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; element can only contain one or more &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; elements. An &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; cannot contain any element within it, so its content model is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Several elements are categorized in HTML 4.01 into &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt;. This is declared in the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html#block"&gt;HTML 4.01  DTD&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!ENTITY % block &amp;quot;P | %heading; | %list; | %preformatted; | DL | DIV | NOSCRIPT | BLOCKQUOTE | FORM | HR | TABLE | FIELDSET | ADDRESS&amp;quot;&amp;gt;and&amp;lt;!ENTITY % inline &amp;quot;#PCDATA | %fontstyle; | %phrase; | %special; | %formctrl;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Each element is then defined in the DTD with what kind of content they can contain. For example, while &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is a block element, it can contain only inline elements according to the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#edef-P"&gt;DTD&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!ELEMENT P - O (%inline;)*            -- paragraph --&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some elements (like &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#edef-ins"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ins&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) can function either as block level or inline elements depending on how they are used. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;HTML 4.01 defines the content models within a DTD, which is referenced by the Doctype declaration at the beginning of a HTML page. In HTML5, the content models are defined within the spec and not in a DTD (this also means you do not have to specify a Doctype, but not doing so will trigger quirks mode in some browsers, so you are recommended to use the HTML5 Doctype &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;h3&gt;What's new in HTML5?&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;HTML5 does away with block and inline categorization of content. There are now &lt;a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#content-models"&gt;several categories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Metadata content&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Flow content&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Sectioning content&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Heading content&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Phrasing content&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Embedded content&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Interactive content&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Each element can belong to one or more categories, and can behave one way or the other depending on the context. Each of them has an expected list of contents. Here is &lt;a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-index.html#element-content-categories"&gt;a summary of which elements belong to which categories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Why is this good to know?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an experimental&lt;a href="http://www.iandevlin.com/blog/2010/01/html5/enabling-the-html5-parser-in-firefox-3-6"&gt; HTML5 parser available on Firefox 3.6&lt;/a&gt; onwards and &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto25/#html5"&gt;basic HTML 5 parsing available for Opera Presto 2.5 rendering engine&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice to say, when all browsers start parsing HTML5, it will be relevant to know which content is being rendered in what context for writing more semantic code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browsers have, for long, worked around incorrect implementations of the HTML specification, so the more rigorous/semantic we are with our markup, the easier it is for the browser to render!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Or, you can use this knowledge to wisely nod your head when you are trying to parse the messages in the &lt;a href="http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list"&gt;WHATWG mailing list&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently in US people indulge in, what is called, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship">March Madness</a>, and I did not escape the lunacy either. I made a trip to Austin for SXSWi, made my peace with pets, and even started indulging in some American behaviour. With those things accomplished, I felt no guilt for reading just four books.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Slant</h3>




<p>I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0099350815/">Slant</a> early March, and plodded through it by the end of the month. Surprisingly, I liked it (despite all the plodding). It is based in a very contemporary future where software behave like humans and there is a &ldquo;global threat&rdquo; to eliminate humans who have suffered a psychological breakdowns. Jill (a software designed to eliminate the threat) and her creator Nathan Rashid manage to stop that from occurring in the nick of time. The story is not all that interesting, except for the romance between Jill and Roddy (another program) – that was quite well done (as in, I did not feel sick after reading that).</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Amazing Spiderman Death &amp; Dating</h3>


<p></p>

<p>I must have been drugged when I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0785134182/" title="Spider-Man: Death And Dating TPB: Amazon.ca: Marcos Martin, Lee Weeks, Mike McKone, Mark Waid, Roger Stern, Dan Slott: Books">this book</a> because it is not what I usually read. The ideal audience is a pimply 12-year-old looking for a girlfriend and I am glad to say I did not identify with that.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Sandman</h3>


<p></p>

<p>I had read <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-review-for-may-2009.html">Sandman Volumes 2 and 7</a>, so when I chanced upon <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/dp/1401225756/">Volume 1</a>, I picked it up. As usual Neil Gaiman is brilliant. Nothing more needs to be said. He is the best story-teller alive.</p>

<h3>Crash</h3>




<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0312420331/">Crash</a> is supposedly a short read, and I was curious about J G Ballard. It is very well written but I could not proceed to the next page without uttering four-letter curses every few sentences. I did not finish it, and I hope I can find another novel by him that is, ahem, less scandalous.</p>


<p></p>

<p>As usual, I await your recommendations! Any book you recommend? </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is paraphrased from my presentation at <a href="http://refreshseattle.org">Refresh Seattle</a> on March 25th. You can <a href="/refresh-seattle/">view the presentation</a> or download the <a href="http://github.com/nimbupani/refresh-seattle/">slides from Github</a>.</em></p>


<p></p>

<p>I stumbled onto Sass last January, when I was struggling with  large style sheets of several websites in various states of development.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I work on large, high-traffic websites mostly and maintain at least 10 such sites at any given time. A website that I have not worked on for 2 years or more would suddenly require updates, and I would have to re-learn (what I consider) atrocious coding practices of my old self. Sometimes, these websites acquire new designs based on seasonal promotions. It did not help that most of these websites had more than 5000 lines of CSS.</p>




<p>I started looking for solutions to my CSS maintenance woes. I briefly considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework">CSS frameworks</a>, but these dump a set of properties irrespective of their usage. I also looked at <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LessCSS</a> whose every-rule-is-a-reusable-snippet looked like an even worse maintenance nightmare. Sass looked most promising. I took a chance and am glad to have done so. </p>




<p>Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets. It is written in ruby and has command line tools to convert Sass to CSS, or CSS to Sass. It also includes a “watch” utility that watches a certain folder which contains the Sass files for any changes and automatically compiles updated Sass files to their respective CSS files. </p>




<p>Sass has a different syntax as compared to CSS. Here is a sample Sass file:</p>


<pre>!bordercolor = #000
div.content
  border = 1px "solid" !bordercolor
  h2
     padding: 1px</pre>




<p>This is how the generated CSS looks:</p>




<pre><code>div.content { border: 1px solid #000; }
div.content h2 { padding: 1px; }</code></pre>




<p>Sass is not white-space agnostic, and you need to be careful with the indentation as that decides which parent selector the child selector belongs to. If you would like to learn how to use this in detail, head over to the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html">Official Sass tutorial</a>.</p>




<p>Sass has lots of features, most of which can be found in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html">the  reference documentation</a>. My favourite elements of Sass are: <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins">Mixins</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_">Variables</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#sass_comments_">Sass comments</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import">@import directive</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#functions">Functions</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#control_directives">If/For/While directives</a>, and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#output_style">Output Style formatting</a>.  Several more are undocumented, or are better explained in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/haml">mailing list</a>.</p>




<p><a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a> is a framework built on Sass that makes it easier to use it stand alone on non-ruby projects. Several features that have made into the latest releases of Sass were first created in Compass by <a href="http://chriseppstein.github.com/">Chris Eppstein</a>. Compass makes available many <a href="http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass/supported-frameworks">CSS Frameworks</a> like Blueprint, YUI, and <a href="http://oddbird.net/susy">Susy</a> for use in your Sass files. There is an <a href="http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass/">hour-long introduction to Compass</a> which is definitely worth your time if you are looking to use Sass/Compass in the long-term.</p>




<p>Recently, <a href="http://nex-3.com">Nathan Weizenbaum</a>, the maintainer of Sass, has released <a href="http://nex-3.com/posts/92-firesass-bridges-the-gap-between-sass-and-firebug">FireSass</a>, a firebug plugin that renders the line number and the Sass filename from which a selected HTML element gains its properties instead of the line number and the CSS filename. This makes debugging your stylesheet lot easier if you use Sass primarily.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Nathan is also working on getting Sass 3 beta version out live. It will include a new format called <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/compass-users/browse_thread/thread/a935eda5b860a350">SCSS</a> which replicates the CSS syntax (like LessCSS).</p>


<p></p>

<p>While Sass has a lot of tools, and is quite powerful, it is not necessary that you have to use it. I would recommend you use it only if you:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Have large CSS files that you intend to maintain over a long period of time (in which case, converting them to multiple Sass files is a good idea).
    </li>
    <li>Deal with several websites with markedly different style sheets but would like to create a common library of styles that you can invoke when necessary without writing additional code.</li>
    <li>Write CSS for a living.</li>
</ul>




<p>Sass is not <em>the</em> answer for your CSS ills. You still need to know how to write CSS and your Sass file can be a noodlesoup of unmaintainable nested selectors if you are not mindful. </p>




<p>If you use Textmate, there is a <a href="http://github.com/charlesr/ruby-sass-tmbundle">Ruby Sass Textmate bundle</a> to make it easier to type Sass syntax. There is also a <a href="http://github.com/dougochris/Compass.tmbundle">Compass bundle</a> that lets you look up mixins available in Compass. </p>
