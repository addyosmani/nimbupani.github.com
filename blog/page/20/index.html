  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hesitate to pen down my thoughts on the party that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shankar_Mahadevan">Shankar Mahadevan</a> hosted for us :). Partly because I left half way. Partly because it was astounding and I have an eternal regret of leaving it half way :(</p>

<p>Manu (an infrequent comment-author) had already shown me visions of how good Shankar was, but what I experienced was much more than that! The concert started with his standard &#8220;breathless&#8221; song followed by an oldie by Kishore (eminently forgettable one at that!). Meanwhile, Mahalaxmi also chipped in with a few soulful numbers without much effect on the audience.</p>

<p>The best part of the show were the audience. There were spontaneous team leaders erupting and encouraging people to dance while Shankar urged the same over the mike. What was beautiful was the camaraderie that the crowd developed. An interesting phenomenon is the mobile phone &#8220;swing&#8221; if I can call that. Everyone sways their mobile phones which looked like stars dotting a black sky. Beautiful.</p>

<p>SEY&#8217;s &#8220;Pretty Woman&#8221; performance was amazing too! Shankar invited a few girls on stage and the girls shrieked their hearts out! I did feel that the &#8220;Take it Easy Policy&#8221; performance was quite slow but Shankar was quick to detect it and stopped the music and asked the audience to sing &#8220;Take it Easy Policy&#8221; and started again. But it just became slightly faster but not as fast as the original song. But, the saving grace, was the &#8220;jugalbandhi&#8221; between the drummer and the tabla player. And the finale of the jugalbandhi where Ehsaan joined them for getting back to the song was mind blowing.</p>

<p>And then came the frenzy-causing song &#8220;Naach Baliye&#8221;, and everyone danced their hearts out (including me and Manu!). A few oldies were caught in between, but they did respectably stand and watch :)</p>

<p>There were quite a few profs from IIT to watch the show (Manu pointed a few), and I couldn&#8217;t keep track of their &#8220;dancing skills&#8221; as the crowd effectively cut me off from everything except the view of the stage.</p>

<p>And yes, I left an hour and a half after the show began missing out the second half which was even better, the newspapers say. And the reason was safety. Even though I fear no road nor man in Singapore, <a href="http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/">Uma&#8217;s posts</a> and the recent <a href="http://www.ciol.com/content/news/2005/105121704.asp">BPO employee&#8217;s murder</a> did not give me confidence in getting back alone without company. And, so, with eternal regret, I left the concert early.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Crossposted at <a href="http://www.naachgaana.com/item/1317">Naachgaana</a></p>

<p>Bobby is a movie that captivated the masses and pushed Dimple to stardom. In fact, there is a site that is dedicated to <a href="http://www.bollywood501.com/films/bobby/">everything about Bobby</a> - including the fashion styles (which explains far better than I do!). But what I like about Bobby is the poster which is just a reflection of the psychedelic 70s. In fact, it is the only movie to have such psychedelic posters (Garam Masala tries to, but doesnt quite create this effect).</p>

<p>It is obvious why the film has such posters when you watch the movie. Even though the plot is as old as Raj Kapoor, the costumes that the actors wear is as scandalous and as far from reality as it can get. In that sense, it is a radical departure from &#8220;normal movies&#8221; where the designers stick to being as less creative as possible.</p>

<p>This movie introduces the <a href="http://www.bollywood501.com/films/bobby/htm/gallery4j.html">ubiquitous scarves</a> - this style didn&#8217;t reach the masses till the early 80s and persisted till the 90s! It does look good with the clothes Dimple wears in the film, but when used with frumpy oversized salwaar kameezes and jeans, it looks quite disgusting! Whew, I was so glad when people started getting over this hideous design! In fact, this film introduces several design elements which were all contorted to suit the moral taste of India and became hideous in that process.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bollywood501.com/films/bobby/htm/gallery2d.html">The polka top</a> is another. I remember wearing a similar top except it reached beyond my waist! Ugh, I get depressed every time I reflect on my dressing sense in the 90s :)</p>

<p>Bobby is a film you should watch for the Indian take on the psychedelic 70s look. Now you know how well the poster fits the movie!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fourteen years ago, the only way I knew I stayed somewhere near the &#8220;heart of Tollywood&#8221; is through the presence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalini">Baby Shalini&#8217;s</a> house nearby and the large crowds that gather at one of the last vestiges of city living: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandamuri_Taraka_Rama_Rao">NTR&#8217;s house</a>. It had completely escaped my mind, till recently, to check and update those two references that remind me of the Tinsel Town. So, after fourteen years, I am ashamed to say one of those bonds that used to bind me to Tinsel Town is No More.</p>

<p>Shalini&#8217;s house is kept intact by their rather wolf-like dog. It is the NTR&#8217;s house has bitten the dust. Two cramped apartments have taken over and one of the blocks has been lovingly named after the Super Star Krishna. A very sad end - not unlike the tragedy of the NTR&#8217;s demise -  to a very majestic building.</p>

<p>The only reason I remember NTR&#8217;s bunglow is because it used to signal the last sign of humanity for me in that area. Beyond that building was a large sparse road, surrounded by the Most Foul Smelling garbage dump. There werent even street lights at that time. And, in such a desolate landscape, with only smelly pigs for company, NTR&#8217;s bungalow was a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>Fourteen years on, the pigs have vanished and so has the dump. They have all been taken over by apartments of various shapes and sizes. &#8220;Desolate&#8221; is not the word that will strike you when you see them.</p>

<p>Time Changes Everything.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;one year away from home does things to you.</p>

<p>For starters, your nose gets blocked as soon as you set foot on the soil.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes from all over the world arrive to attack you on your open pores creating convex craters all over the visible surface. There goes your plan to wear something &#8220;minimal&#8221; to beat the heat.</p>

<p>You detest dirt. Dirt sickens you, disgusts you. You spend hours cleaning the house, imagining yourself as the Pasteur of this century, emptying bottles of Dettol and Savlon into every possible crevice. Of course, dust and dirt promptly return within a few seconds of doing so.</p>

<p>The house looks smaller than before or perhaps I am &#8220;fatter&#8221; than before?</p>

<p>Anyways, this trip has awakened the cricket fan in me which had been dormant since the first match fixing rumour. Virender Sehwag rocks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Will be in India from Jan 15th till Feb 1st Week. Short trip to Mumbai likely. Would love to meet you all there! :) Cant wait for my dose of Indian Reality. Experiencing Chennai on a yearly basis is like meeting your parents once a year (which I do) and noticing how they have grown :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saurin asked me to watch <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com/acting-like-a-thief/">Acting Like a Thief</a>. It is quite a short movie but raises critical questions.</p>

<p>As the site says, it brings to the front the struggles of the actors from the community of &#8220;thieves&#8221;. The police torture, the shame, the embarassment, and trying to find a job, and a career that is so poignantly presented in the 15 minutes.</p>

<p>These guys are doing something that makes a difference to the society in ways unimaginable. Please support them by <a href="http://www.justgive.org/giving/donate.jsp?charityId=18937&designation=Hooch%20and%20Hamlet">donating</a> to their cause, so that they can create the bigger film and popularise the cause of Chharas.</p>

<p>You would think this is a stampede caused by some crazy discount sale in Takashimaya. But it isnt.</p>

<p>This crowd is, in fact, split into two factions - one trying to get to Takashimaya and one trying to get out. It so happens that they meet each other at the entrance of Isetan.</p>

<p>Each is as strong as the other, so it is an impasse. Smart people (like me0 from either crowds abandon their positions and run inside Isetan and get out of the tunnel and brave the torturous rain that is pouring outside. Others, stay there and test their body strength by trying to push their way through.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457875/">Ek Ajnabee</a> - one of those dustbin movies - when I realised that the movie&#8217;s hero is none but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan">Big B</a>. I dont remember any actor who has succeeded as well as him in carrying an entire masala film on his own as an old man of 63.</p>

<p>I just realised that the roles he gets these days are no different from those in the 70s - only he is older. Now, just like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/">Sean Connery</a>, he looks more charming with age, and does the Angry Old Man role! The only female actor who can match with such charisma and dignity at an old age would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waheeda_Rehman">Waheeda Rehman</a>. But then, she hasnt acted much in recent years, but no one else in Indian Cinema have found fame and popularity playing themselves as old men AND heroes at the sametime!</p>

<p>I am now a fan of Amitabh Bachchan.</p>
