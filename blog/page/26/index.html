  <div class="entry-content"><p>I almost missed mentioning <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87967025@N00/sets/942515/">Software Freedom Day</a> that was held at Orchard Road on September 10th. I think the mainstream media missed it too&#8230;sigh.</p>

<p>Anyways, seems like the Software Freedom Day was a riot! We had a tux that was dawdling among kids, screechy delirious teenages, respectful grandmothers and grandfathers.</p>

<p><a href="http://antrix.net">Deepak S</a> and <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak J</a> were volunteering by evangelising Ubuntu, the new mac OS of the Free Software World, and distributing free copies of the same.</p>

<p>Next year, we better get some HOT cheerleaders to distribute and propogate the Free Software Movement ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An exhibition of Singapore&#8217;s acclaimed watercolor artist <a href="http://www.ongkimseng.com">Ong Kim Seng</a> is up at the 36th Floor of <a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=106364">Capital Tower</a>.</p>

<p>I love watercolor art as  most of them slant towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism">impressionist style of painting</a> - there is a lot of meaning in what is left unsaid.</p>

<p>Back to Mr. Ong, Ong Kim Seng&#8217;s paintings were AMAZING. I know I generally gloat over most artists, but the collection that was on display was awesome. Some of them were normal but many distinguished themselves by both the attention to detail and the delibrate lack of details. I really loved the way he creates focus areas on his paintings through a high contrast and making it  an oasis of serenity in the midst of noise all around in the paintings.</p>

<p>The paintings I best liked are not online anywhere =(, if you guys find them do let me know, they were: Shadow on the Wall, Emerald Hill, and Rando Spain. Loved Emerald Hill, especially the use of color!</p>

<p>I am a true fan after reading his FAQ entry that he didnt learn painting from anyone!</p>

<p>He has also written a book on &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1929834233/104-9403162-5159137?v=glance">Mastering Light and Shade</a>&#8221;, which is now on my Must-Buy List!</p>

<p>Also, Mr. Ong has a <a href="http://www.ongkimseng.com/paintings/india_paint.htm">full gallery dedicated to paintings from India</a> =D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We met yesterday at a little known comfortable cafe called <a href="http://www.themindcafe.com.sg/">The Mind&#8217;s Cafe</a>. A few of them had already made themselves home at the venue while people kept trooping in.</p>

<p>It was refreshing to see new faces and new blogs! The Celebrity who I invited to join - <a href="http://fpstwins.rediffblogs.com">Chetan Bhagat</a> - came! and it was awesome to share with him about his first book and the upcoming one! He has a very beautiful wife Anusha (who should hopefully start blogging soon!).</p>

<p>We also had another non-blogger Sunil (who just Stands Out because of his height!) who is into podcasting! <a href="http://preetamrai.com">Preetam</a> as usual was fascinating us with his stories and tales while I caught up with <a href="http://Sadagopan.net">Sadagopan</a>, <a href="http://krossed.blogspot.com">Marasim</a>, <a href="http://queenofspices.blogspot.com">Anispice</a>, <a href="http://sambharmafia.blogspot.com">Kaps</a> and <a href="http://Mitokondrion.blogspot.com">Mitokondrion</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://opinion.paifamily.com">Nitin</a> dropped by later coz of his blogging assignments =D (which just goes to show how dedicated he is!). Later, as the evening drew to a close, several made their way to the National Library and a few of us headed to Dhoby Ghaut for some dinner.</p>

<p>It was a fun evening with lots of people. But next time we better orgazine some calorie burning activity instead of a normal gathering =D (for my selfish interest of course =D).</p>

<p><a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak J</a> developed a java command line flickr uploader - which means seamless syntaxibility in Windows, Linux and other OSes running Java. Apparently it can handle batch processing too. Watch out for <a href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com/2005/09/futureware.html">Deepak&#8217;s Blog Entry</a> for details.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I worked at office, ate like a pig, and fought off some flab in a pilates class.</p>

<p><strong>More Mac Goodness:</strong> A <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">normal looking phone with iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a> are the latest &#8220;blessings&#8221; from Steve Jobs to us addicts. And I guess they are listening to the market after all.</p>

<p>Wonder how much more Steve Jobs can squeeze the iPod dry. iPod nano comes in black too! Wonder why there is no pink =(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I was rejected by DBS when I applied for my credit card. I had applied again (assuming it was my bad handwriting, but received no response from them. And today, I got a call now from one of the call centers for DBS in India (specifically South India):</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I am calling from DBS Bank, blah blah..you can enjoy lower/higher interest rates with your DBS Credit Card funds. And..&#8221;
</em>
&#8220;I dont have a DBS credit card.&#8221;</p>

<p>[A Pause]</p>

<p><em>&#8220;But you have applied for that right?&#8221; </em>
&#8220;Yeah, but I have not received any response yet.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Oh okay, you will be getting it soon. Thank You. Good Bye.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Weird!</p>

<p>On the subject of humour, check this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4204412.stm">BBC article on the reality of advertising</a>! It is hilarious! One sample:</p>

<blockquote>Women only wear spectacles in adverts for opticians.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I went to show my face for the first and last time at the <a href="http://www.singaporewritersfest.com.sg/">Singapore Writers Festival</a>, to meet <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> and to show off my communist tendencies with this shirt:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/40014769_370b574fd5.jpg" alt="Me with the CopyFighter Shirt, Cory and Deepak Sarda" ></p>

<p>[L-R:Me, <a href="http://craphound.com">Cory</a> and <a href="http://antrix.net">Antrix</a>]</p>

<p>The talk was FUN! Cory Doctorow can speak and he spoke &#8220;non-stop&#8221; about Copyright issues. And do get this guys, we are not against copyright but we are against restricting freedom in the name of copyright. One thing that will stay on my mind is the example of absurditiy of copyright he gave about the recent murmurs of extending copyright protection upto 70 years to any author. He said copyright protection encourages living authors to write more but extending such a protection to DEAD authors will NEVER encourage them to write any more! There is NO INCENTIVE to do that!</p>

<p>Oh, about the shirt again, I thought I will be one of the teeming millions who will attend the talk wearing the same shirt. I was wrong! Imagine my surprise to see I was the only one!</p>

<p>Even though blogging fever has caught on, other facets like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_commons">Creative Commons</a>, BoingBoing and cool stuff discovered through blogging has not! And I think this is no surprise given that Singapore government is taking pains to define blogs as &#8220;diaries&#8221;!</p>

<p>Cory also had some criticism for the Singapore government which has paddled along with the US in its FTA and enthusiastically made piracy criminal!</p>

<p>Several thoughtful ideas came up, like how piracy is not an issue for big broadcasters, software manufacturers, etc as much as disappointed audience and lack of people in the theatres or in the shops. And how if there was a three day slip in the making of the War of the WOrlds, the theatres would have been empty on July 4th (the day it was released). And making movies or products with such high dependency on timing is simply unsustainable.</p>

<p>My thought (inspired form Cory&#8217;s talk), as I told Cory too, is that what RIAA and others are attempting to do is similar to what cryptographers did before WWII - Security Through Obscruity. Preventing Piracy will somehow give them more profits, more success. Preventing people from accessing their software, their movies will simply bring down the entire system (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">like it did for the Germans in WW2</a>).</p>

<p>We then wandered about and got a 20% discount voucher from Kinokuniya for filling up the &#8220;feedback survey&#8221; form about Cory&#8217;s Talk. Also, this is when Cory walked up and said &#8220;I like your shirt&#8221; (or as <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">this Deepak</a> spitefully says &#8220;you were hovering around Cory like a butterfly&#8221;). Heheh, got to take a pic with the <a href="http://antrix.net">Antrix Deepak</a> and Cory. Antrix Deepak also got a self printed and self bound book for Cory to be autographed!</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/40014752_a5a7011e1d_m.jpg" alt="Cory's Autograph on his own book!" /></p>

<p>Finally, after tearing ourselves apart from the Cory Spell, we roamed around town and came back for the Bloggers Nite. As <a href="http://nimbupani.com/back.html-0">I had promised</a>, I did wear my Little Black Dress:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/30/39978645_87fe2d6351_o.jpg" alt="me in my LBD with Cory" ></p>

<p>The Blogger Nite was very quiet which was good coz me, <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> and <a href="http://Ashwink.net/blog/">Ashwin</a> got to talk a lot to Cory. I was very impressed with Cory and he appeared to me like a human Google. Talk veered around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing">Trusted Computing</a> and I finally saw what a catastrophe it would bring along. And I wonder why U.S. Senators dont see that [Dear old <a href="http://www.enron.com/corp/">Enron</a> could have gotten away with Trusted COmputing].</p>

<p>Oh, Deepak J also got Cory to sign on one of Cory&#8217;s fav book by Ian Mcdonald which tickled Cory to no end!</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/32/40014833_0723c3d195_m.jpg" alt="Cory's autograph on Flickr" /></p>

<p>Got to meet a lot of people like <a href="http://ambarbriastuti.blogspot.com/">Ambar</a>, <a href="http://www.andersbrink.com/blog/">Andres Brink</a>, <a href="http://www.dsng.net/">Daryl</a>.</p>

<p>After an eventful two hours, <a href="http://Preetamrai.com">Preetam</a> took us out to a pub nearby (Que Pasa) which just floored me with its antique decor. They even had ancient newspapers plastered on the wall!</p>

<p>Two drinks later, I was headed home.</p>
