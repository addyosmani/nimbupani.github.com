  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7129379/" title="Photo Sharing" class="pic"><img src="http://photos7.flickr.com/7129379_8ef524876e_o.jpg" width="443" height="332" alt="Trains Cross Each Other" /></a></p>

<p>So after the brilliant birthday party at <a href="http://chetan.ckunte.com">Chetan&#8217;s house</a> and all the hoo-haa of Bukit Bintang, we went off to a blissful sleep to wake up at 6 a.m. After a good breakfast, we proceeded to travel through the KL public transport to go to Sepang. The taxis were having a field day charging around 150-200 ringgits just to take people to Sepang and get them back!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7129380/" title="Photo Sharing" class="pic"><img src="http://photos8.flickr.com/7129380_712d1d1afa_o.jpg" width="332" height="443" alt="Inside a Komuter Train" /></a></p>

<p>The Komuter was actually good! It was clean and neat and was air conditioned! But the most important draw back of Komuter trains are they are extremely slow.  Or maybe it was just the distance! I dont know.
We reached Sepang and realised why it was the hottest racing track in the world. It was BURNING! It was as if somebody placed a magnifying glass on that part of Malaysia! To add to my woes, I was wearing jeans and shoes! Argh&#8230;cant forget the 45 minutes we had to spend standing or walking in the heat to get to our stand.</p>

<p>The funny part in getting to the stand is the security checks. They dont allow water, umbrellas, or food! And just a few meters away, people were throwing their water bottles and food stuff over the fence so that after the security checks they can go to the other side and collect them! Security at its worst! One of my friends tried another clever trick. He put a half-filled water bottle in the front of his bag and kept the other at the back. The security &#8220;found&#8221; the half filled bottle and then took it out and stopped checking! =)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7129385/" title="Photo Sharing" class="pic"><img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/7129385_7688a82885_o.jpg" width="443" height="332" alt="View of the Sepang Grand Prix Track" /></a></p>

<p>This is what you get to see once you are inside the stand. Thankfully it was covered! I do not know how those in the stands without the shade coped!</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ayekay/7161068/" class="pic"><img src="http://photos7.flickr.com/7161068_f0967913b1_m.jpg" alt="My sketch"/></a></p>

<p>Once we settled ourselves on the cosy bedsheets that Ayekay had thoughtfully brought along, we started munching on the food stuff that we managed to sneak in. The qualifying round just got over and we were waiting for the carrera race to start. I wanted to try my hand at sketching as there was a lot of time before the race started.</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ayekay/7161067" class="pic"><img src="http://photos6.flickr.com/7161067_02ab3a853f_m.jpg" alt="ayekay's rendering of what I was drawing"/></a></p>

<p><a href="http://ultimatenigma.blogspot.com">Ayekay</a> had meanwhile captured the view that I was drawing! So now I can complete the sketch at home!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7129637/" title="Photo Sharing" class="pic"><img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/7129637_9626bc55fc_o.jpg" width="443" height="332" alt="Indian Flags all over" /></a></p>

<p>One thing I could notice was the profusion of Indian flags! Some of our other friends and seniors from NTU also brought along an Indian flag and it was as if a cricket match was going to start!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7129638/" title="Photo Sharing" class="pic"><img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/7129638_66d4eb4d3e_o.jpg" width="443" height="332" alt="Carrera Car Race" /></a></p>

<p>A smaller race then started with these funny cars. Not that I cared much about these cars :P</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ayekay/7161066/" class="pic"><img src="http://photos8.flickr.com/7161066_a7d09baedf_m.jpg" alt="The winning Carrera from Ayekay's binoculars"/></a></p>

<p>Ayekay was playing around with his binoculars to swat away his boredom and figured out there was a good way of taking pictures without a zoom lens, through the binoculars. With the dexterity that only those-who-know-to-use-binoculars-with-cameras can have, he got some cool snaps. But of course the snaps have a blue tinge because of that. But photoshop can always help in that regard!</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ayekay/7160369" class="pic"><img src="http://photos7.flickr.com/7160369_2a40eabca6_m.jpg" alt="the opening lap"/></a></p>

<p>The big race started and the Renault raced to a lead leaving a big gap between the Renault and the rest of the cars. Another big gap was between the rest of the cars and the last three. And our Indian boy, for whom so many indian flags were splattered all over the stadium, was the best of the three in the opening lap.</p>

<p>The race was interesting and even gripping in parts. But as we didnt have the full view of the track we missed most of the parts that the newspapers reported on later. We simply saw that the ferraris were doing badly and Karthikeyan&#8217;s car was atrocious to say the least.</p>

<p><a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> and myself had an early bus to catch so we decamped from the stadium by 4.30 while the race was supposed to end at 5. Already, people were moving out of the stadium in hordes and we luckily managed to catch a bus that was dropping us off at Nilai a Komuter station from where we had to take the Komuter to the Old KL station to take the bus to Singapore.</p>

<p>The bus journey from Nilai to Sepang was quick, in less than 15 minutes, but the return back was disastrous. We had budgeted for a 10 minute journey that will leave us comfortably early enough to have a dinner and take the bus to singapore. But the journey back took more than 45 minutes! I had no clue how they managed to find such a long winded way. It was very cinematic and I thought we were participating in the Amazong Race, we ran and ran and ran and finally managed to board the bus to Singapore with two minutes to spare.</p>

<p>Whew! I promptly fell asleep in the bus and managed to wake up for some light dinner on the malaysian soil before the picture perfect greenery of singapore greeted us and the humdrum of daily life beckoned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Landed in the wee hours of a saturday morning after getting fleeced by a cab driver for driving us to the hotel at such a time (triple the normal rate of RM 6). We arrived to face the dour and rude faces manning the reception and the security counters at the Z grade <a href="http://www.wirahotel.com.my/">Hotel Wira</a>. Thankfully, the bad service stopped there as I found the rooms to be in good condition and clean.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7126480/" class="pic" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/7126480_f27c039f86_o.jpg" alt="KhaLsa" /></a></p>

<p>After a bit of a sleep, we freshened up to climb the 272 steps of <a href="http://www.malaysiasite.nl/batucaveseng.htm">Batu Caves</a> which are just a few minutes off KL. In fact they are the biggest identifiable landmarks around KL. You can see them from most parts of KL (though I admit I havent been to several others).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7126741/" class="pic" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos6.flickr.com/7126741_467c83fd30_o.jpg"  alt="Limestone Caves" /></a></p>

<p>Batu Caves were beautiful. It is technically like the <a href="http://murugan.org/temples/palani.htm">Palani Malai</a> of T.N. as it is the abode of Murugar, though here, its his &#8220;Vel&#8221; that is worshipped. We reached Batu Caves by 7.30 a.m. and the guy at the counter below the mountain said the temples open by 8 a.m. and that it will take that much time anyway to climb the hill!</p>

<p>I was shocked that the temple was opening so late as compared to those in India or Singapore and incensed by his assumption that I would take so long to climb those steps -which is why I think I completed the climb in five minutes =)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7126742/" class="pic"  title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos6.flickr.com/7126742_3de5e52ebe_o.jpg"  alt="View of KL from Batu Caves" /></a></p>

<p>Batu Caves apparently are limestone formations. It was heavenly. The view from the caves is gorgeous and the holy shrines just makes you want to worship even if you were an atheist. There are several &#8220;caves&#8221; but most of them were locked when we went. Only the main shrine was open.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7126744/" class="pic" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/7126744_fcc526c57e_o.jpg"  alt="Graffiti inside Batu Caves" /></a></p>

<p>The cave has its fair share of graffiti and it was sad to see graffitti painted with those aerosol cans that are really ugly to look at.</p>

<p>Surprisingly the caves do not seem to have bats. And even more surprising is the fact that there are two roosters within the caves which get constantly chased by the monkeys.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the real pests of the place -monkeys. I hope some biologist does a study of the monkeys here to determine how brain evolves. These monkeys can detect even the slightest movement of food and have highly evolved techniques of extracting food from the happless people. I saw one threatening a poor woman into giving him/her a packet! TO those non-believers in evolution, please visit Batu Caves to see how closely we relate to these creatures. We almost share the same qualities!</p>

<p>We next stopped by the KL telecommunications tower which is technically taller than the Petronas as it is situated on a hill. From here you can see the whole of KL and they have rightly or wrongly installed powerful nikon binoculars which can zoom to the entrance of batu caves and lets you actually see the people moving there. Batu caves is 15 km off KL!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7127163/" class="pic" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/7127163_1a8a4d1158_o.jpg"  alt="Menara KL" /></a></p>

<p>So if you go to <a href="http://www.menarakl.com.my/main.cfm">KL tower</a>, the whole of KL comes under your scrutiny. If you think your wife is cheating on you, and you happen to lie in KL do not waste time in detectives, simply spend RM 6 and go to the KL tower and look at every nook and corner as you please!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7127387/" class="pic" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/7127387_c9d2e149f9_o.jpg"  alt="Below the Petronas (inside Suria KLCC)" /></a></p>

<p>Next stop was supposed to be Petronas, but I stumbled across the Isetan in the <a href="http://www.suriaklcc.com.my/">Suria KLCC</a> and never looked back. Spent almost two hours shopping at jaw dropping prices! Whew, never felt so tired ever.</p>

<p>Deepak and I then looked up <a href="http://umaipadam.blogspot.com">Maran</a> who kindly took us to Little India in KL. It was awesome to meet him and he was really funny and humourous! After some two hours we headed off to <a href="http://chetan.ckunte.com/archives/2005/03/20/aaryana-is-now-5">Aaryana&#8217;s birthday party</a>.</p>

<p>It was an amusing party with kids all over the place. They even had a clown! I was totally mesmerised by her magic tricks and games! The best part was the birthday cake! It was a barbie doll dressed up in loads and loads of cream! Woah! I never knew I was so deprived as a child ;-) Mummy, I want my barbie doll cake =D The foood was DELICIOUS! slurrpp still savouring it =)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vyom/7128972/" class="pic" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/7128972_a1fa5e96c9_o.jpg"  alt="View of Monorail Track at Bukit Bintang" /></a></p>

<p>We then roamed around <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/storyx1000.asp?file=/2001/1/30/nation/3011crco&sec=">Bukit Bintang</a> which was, unlike the Orchard road in Singapore, alive and very active at 12 in the night! Amazing night life!! Every shop, small or big, is open! Singapore, you can never compete with KL for the experience, alright? No use pretending to have a night life when there is none.</p>

<p>Finally we all went back to the rat hole and rested.</p>

<p>Whew, that was a LONGGG entry. The next day beckons&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It wasnt supposed to be one. It was supposed to be a F1 trip. But turned out that I shopped more than I ever did in the last two years. But the prices were so cheap that I actually didnt spend more than 100 dollars on the whole (including a coool new backpack which came under S$30!).</p>

<p>More on the trip later. I met up with <a href="http://chetan.ckunte.com">Chetan</a> and <a href="http://umaipadam.blogspot.com">Maran</a>. Lovely time. KL is AWESOME. I hope Indian cities grow up to be somewhat similar to KL =).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/blog/images/google_divya.jpg" alt="nimbupani as the first result for divya"/></p>

<p>..this blog is the first result in google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=divya">Divya</a>! YAY!</p>

<p>I have been tracking the google dance for a week. In the last two weeks, <a href="http://nimbupani.com">Nimbupani</a> was the first result for few hours off and on.
