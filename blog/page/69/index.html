  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I attended a &#8216;Recruitment Talk&#8217; by one of the Big Four ( after Andersen&#8217;s shameful fall) of the Consulting Industry, <a href="http://www.bcg.com">Boston Consuting Group</a>. Boy, all the castles I had dreamed of buying went away in a &#8216;pff&#8217;.</p>

<p>Okay, this is what that happened. This company wants its people to play hard and work hard. That&#8217;s fine by me. It loves to have people who are addicted to challenges. That&#8217;s not fine by me, but given the amount of money they pay, it&#8217;s probably worth being a slave. It wants people with First Class Honours. Now, that&#8217;s definitely NOT fine by me. I can&#8217;t even dream of getting anywhere near First Class ( unless I score distinctions in every subject from now on).</p>

<p>To top it all, they have atleast 6 to 7 gruelling rounds of interview and select just ONE person out of some thousand candidates to join their branch in Singapore. And what&#8217;s more, their company has just 37 people working in Singapore! And just 2,600 people worldwide! (even Enron had more employees on this planet than BCG!)</p>

<p>Well, the point is, they give no room for error. So, if you were on a binge the night before an exam, bad luck, you will never get to work at BCG ( unless you make up for that with some distinctions in your kitty).  Oh well, I guess that&#8217;s why they are still one of the Big Four!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What do you say when the alarm clock blares off at 3 a.m.? Especially when you dozed off at midnight? And on top of that, you never get sleep after that catastrophic, earth-shaking alarm.</p>

<p>Agreed, that is precisely the function of an alarm clock, but only if its your own! :(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.jivha.com/blog/archives/000406.html">This</a> article got me thinking. Indian advertisers have recently <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/business/showbusinessstory.asp?slug=Indian+advertising+goes+global&id=14939">started winning a lot of awards</a>.  And truly, they deserve all the accolades.</p>

<p>The most wonderful ads I have seen are from <a href="http://www.agencyfaqs.com/tvc/sboard/raymond_pals_2211_2001.html">Raymond</a> and <a href="http://www.amulgreetings.com/">Amul</a>. Of course, Cadbury&#8217;s and Bajaj also used to have good ads once in a while. But the most famous ad is the one for <b>Nirma Washing Powder</b>. The girl, who whirls around in a white frock, is the source of lots of myths and mysteries.  One voice  said the girl died young. Another cooed that the girl was the Company Owner&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>But whatever it may be, this is the most enduring ad and the most loved. As enduring as <a href="http://www.intelindia.com/mahabharat/synopsis_ramayan.htm">Ramayana</a> and <a href="http://www.intelindia.com/mahabharat/mbondvd.htm">Mahabharata</a></p>

<p>P.S: I would be very grateful if you could pass the Nirma Ad to me. I couldnt find it on the internet. Nirma nostalgia beckons  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of feathers are flying between two debaters about the existence of God. <a href="http://nandini.zblogger.com">Nan</a> and <a href="http://artanis.zblogger.com">Artanis</a> have been at <a href="http://nandini.zblogger.com/pagine/archive/id..08_03_2003_08_09_2003_archive.html">loggerheads</a> for quite sometime. Perhaps this <a href="http://www.biota.org/people/douglasadams/index.html">speech by Douglas Adams</a> should quieten things down for a while (from <a href="http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/">Srijith</a>).</p>

<p>Douglas Adams is not an author I particularly like. I was planning to have a major slaughter of his &#8220;A Dark Tea Time of the Soul&#8221; in here, but I couldnt even get myself to finish the book. But his &#8220;Hitchhiker &#8216;s guide to the Galaxy&#8221; is supposed to be the best. Anyways, what he says seems be exactly my views (but layered and buttered better).
<B>Warning</B> Any comments resembling a debater&#8217;s speech will be delete instantly!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was researching for my Final Year Project, when it struck me how useful <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> web browser is. Then I decided to pay tribute to this wonderful utility which is still free!!! :)</p>

<p>Well, of course I can hear you all go &#8217; Not Again!&#8217; but still, really, isnt it great that a &#8216;g Rastapopoulos&#8217; on the address bar does the excellent task of cutting through the formality of going to Google and THEN typing all this!( Sheer waste of time!)</p>

<p>(P.S. Those who dont know Rastapopoulos need to put their heads down in shame. Its the <a href="http://paul.durdin.net/tintin/baddies.php">Baddie</a> of <a href="http://www.tintin.com">Tintin</a> and if you havent read tintin, you are missing something really big in life.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our University library is really huge, resembling more of a cyber cafe than a library. Of course, all the computers in there run WinXP, which makes life a little easier. I will tell you why.</p>

<p>There is something called a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWSXP/pro/using/howto/gomobile/remotedesktop/default.asp">Remote Desktop</a> ( You must enable it on your desktop first). You can then access this desktop from anywhere in the world (literally!). I know I can access the drives on my desktop in the room from the terminal using this feature. But the best part is when the reverse happens. My room computer (if accessed through the library terminal) can directly connect to the library&#8217;s printers.Now, I can directly print stuff to the library printer without having the hassle of copying the stuff into a public directory and copying them again into the library computer drive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anybody who gets up at 8.30 for a 10.30 class and still reaches late to the class will be considered a moron by this men-infested world. This person is a moron if he is not a <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/metrosexual.asp">metrosexual</a> . Emphatically not, if its a woman.</p>

<p>Seriously, the amount of precious time women spend on thinking what to wear, if used in other ways, could have led to the colonization of Andromeda Galaxy :) But for me, this decision is the most important moment in my day. It can make or break my temper, depends on whether <I>&#8216;I do&#8217;</I> or <I>&#8216;I dont&#8217; </I>according to this flowchart :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href=http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CPicZ.aspx?E=I_2S5RYD1MUSQG&o=THT">This</a> is a picture from a photobook. For some weird reason I cant link to the whole photobook as such. If you are interested, go to <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/TreePfTop.aspx?E=A_29YL53DLU3P&V=Photographers"> Magnum</a> and look for the book  &#8220;Dog Dog&#8221; under the photographer called <B>Erwitt Elliot</B>.</p>

<p>Its a tribute to dogs in all their forms.  The first expression that comes to your mind will be &#8220;oh! so cuuute!&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, really what is a man without a dog? Either its your best friend  or your worst enemy. I have never come across the first case, but have many experiences of the second.</p>

<p>All dogs I come across regard me as one mortal enemy that they should never leave out of their ferocious sight. It still rankles me, when I think of thew day I came thhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiis close  to being bitten by a ferocious dog. Ever since, I have kept my distance from these enemies.</p>

<p>Some day, I would like it if the dogs let me pet them. Sigh, I think the day will never come .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know how callous the MNCs have always been, given their ability to wrangle away from any situation by greasing a few palms of the Government. Right from <a href="http://www.bhopal.com">Union Carbide</a> to <a href="http://www.tni.org/energy/pe/enron.htm">Enron</a>, the MNCs have cared two hoots about Indians or their safety. Now here are the other giants who have bitten the dust. The Centre for Science and Environment has found out that <a href="http://www.myenjoyzone.com/">Coca-Cola&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://www.pepsi.com">Pepsi&#8217;s</a> soft drinks <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030807-042913-1661r">contain pesticide residues far in excess of the European Union Norms</a>.</p>

<p>The citizens were rightly concerned in the 70s which led to a demand for the MNCs to turn partly desis This made Coca-Cola withdraw from the Indian Market. ( it did not make an appearance till the 1990s when these restrictions were lifted). It is necessary that the MNCs realise that in any country, the safety and security of its citizens comes first. The behaviour of Pepsi and Coke smacks of imperialism, which was last seen in the East India Company (the company that &#8216;conquered&#8217; India). Its about time the MNCs realise that when in Rome they have to be Romans.</p>
