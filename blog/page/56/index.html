  <div class="entry-content"><p>-RANT BEGINS-</p>

<p>Visiting <a href="http://www.zeldman.com">Zeldman.com</a>, I found a link to the redesigned <a href="http://nypl.org/">New York Public Library</a>. And it&#8217;s way too awesome! I hope this will pave the way for a redesign of the unsuable <a href="http://www.nlb.gov.sg">island&#8217;s library site</a>.</p>

<p>The first reason why I need to heap praises on this excellent piece of art is that it is so <i>usable</i>. The front page presents information regarding the library and the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/books/">books and materials</a> presents a page of different databases that i can search. And <a href="http://catnyp.nypl.org/">each</a> <a href="http://leopac.nypl.org/">catalog&#8217;s link</a> is easy to remember and just typing that in would get you to the search area for that catalog. And what&#8217;s more each catalog loads zillion times faster than the Singapore&#8217;s online library &#8220;catalogue&#8221;.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nlb.gov.sg">National Library of Singapore</a> has a link to a mysteriously named &#8220;catalogue&#8221; on its main page. On clicking that, you are asked to choose two &#8220;databases&#8221; -one of which is that of a Military Institute, though I have no idea why I would search the database of a military institute (which deserves a separate search icon on the main page). And then finally, after a long wait (during which I try to count the number of vowels in the Page-Loading message - and always have time for a recheck),  I see a semblance of a search page loading. This is where my quest to search library materials should technically end. But it doesn&#8217;t, I am again asked to choose the mode of my search -Easy or Advanced, after which, I get to <i>actually</i> search what I want. And I always regret visitng the site.</p>

<p>Another regret is the pathetic use of colors. From what I have seen, all government owned organizations use horrible colur schemes. Be it on a <a href="http://www.ura.gov.sg/">website</a> or on multistoried apartments built by the <a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/isoa032p.nsf/infoweb?openframeset">Housing Development Board</a>. The apartments are sights for sore eyes, freshly painted with sickly blue and each having the block number painted over the WHOLE building in pink!</p>

<p>P.S. Note the use of frames in both the Government Websites. Specifically note the color of the &#8220;e-services&#8221; banner ad that kills your vision in the HDB site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://tragicomix.blogspot.com">tragicomix</a> has started blogging (dunno if I should mention his/her name or not.. for fear of invasion of privacy).

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/blog/files/wall.jpg" alt=" the chinese heritage centre wall"></p>

<p>I thought this was a haunted house, till some three years ago some events relating to promoting Chinese heritage started happening in this <a href="http://www.chineseheritagecentre.org/">building</a> started appearing. The  Chinese Heritage Centre is one of the oldest buildings you can ever see in NTU. I love the different colors of blue which provide a soothing contrast to the deep rich earth tone of the bricks.</p>

<p>But anyways, some people believe that some of those closed windows belong to rooms which have never been opened and are presumably haunted :P</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This, of course, was a very haphazard arrangement. Different countries adopted different tactics to make their goods cheaper than the others and conserve the national gold reserves. During the First World War this system was abused by most nations, leading to its downfall.</p>

<p>After the war, as there was no viable alternative to the gold standard, the victors had no choice but to reinstate the Gold Standard. But now both pounds and dollars were used as international currency and U.S. and U.K. held gold reserves to ensure ready liquidity for other countries that wished to exchange their reserve of pounds or dollars for gold.</p>

<p>But anyway, the predictable happened. Britain could no longer sustain the constant outflow of gold from its reserves and it did not have enough reserves to carry on currency conversion (implying it issued more pounds than it had reserves for). U.S. was no less vulnerable, which was the reason for <a href="http://www.austincoins.com/confiscation.htm">confiscation</a> of all private gold collections and nationalization of such gold.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Second World War occurred and war cries drowned the need for a uniform exchange rate system. And finally, realising the growing need for a standardized system to determine exchange rates, the world leaders came up with the Bretton Woods System.</p>

<p>Bretton Woods system was very similar to the previous standard, now, only U.S. promised to redeem the dollar reserves of all other nation by exchanging for gold at a fixed rate. But persistent balance of payments deficit by U.S. reduced its gold reserves and it again became unable to pay for the dollar reserves, abandoning the system altogether. Finally the world settled for an exchange rate system without the backing of any product (e.g. gold).</p>

<p>The history of exchange rates (as any other history) only shows the fondness of humans to repeat mistakes. Now, the ballooning American deficits and ever increasing investment of East Asian countries in American securities are two issues raising serious concern. The present situation is remniscent of the last few years of the era of the Gold Standard, with the U.S. dollar also exhibiting the short run volatility (Iraq war, 9/11) similar to gold. It is not impossible that countries might lose confidence in the U.S. dollar. My FMI tutor had been very worried about the lack of diversity (in terms of saving instruments) in the reserves of Asian Countries and has been an advocate of saving in gold, given its recent stability.</p>

<p>But then I do not think American feds will remain quiet while the world sits up and takes notice of the alarming deficit of U.S. Now that the countries now have an option of investing in the relatively more stable euros, U.S. Dollar now faces serious challenge and a repeat of a colossal failure.</p>

<p>This was taken near the edge of the NTU Universe overlooking the dirty sea ports and foul smelling-smoke spewing factories.</p>

<p>This picture concludes my series of pictures in and around <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg">my university</a>. Don&#8217;t think there is anything worth shooting otherwise, except perhaps the <a href="http://www.hall14.com/info.htm">hall of residence</a> bathed in horrible yellow - the very idea of shooting it is depressing.  But the passage of years have somehow dimmed the intensity of the color and hopefully a few more years later, it would have turned a lot more tamer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/blog/files/tower.jpg" alt="construction of biological school of sciences in NTU"></p>

<p>There is not a day in the history of NTU that has passed without some construction or the other going on in some parts of it.  The unfortunate part of such continuous tasks are the different types of architecture, through which you can predict when the building was planned. Another side effect is the mismash of weird colours. Right now the NTU Architects are fascinated by the color blue. The building you see in the background is the upcoming school iof Biological Sciences.</p>

NTU exam answers leaked on the Net
by Jane Ng
 
 AFTER an accountancy exam at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on Wednesday, at least one student went up to a lecturer saying some course-mates had seen online answers to the exam they had just sat.

 These answers had been available on NTU&#8217;s website days before the exam, the student added. 

 Some of the 350 second-year students taking the accounting measurement and disclosure paper are believed to have brought the answers along for the exam, as they were allowed to take in textbooks and notes.

 But whether they used the answers, which did not appear online with the questions, is not clear. Some of them apparently did not realise the answers were for the exam they were sitting.

 Now, the university is investigating how those answers ended up on the site and whether students need to retake the exam.

 According to the dean of the business programme, Professor Vijay Sethi, investigations are expected to take a few days. The school will decide on its course of action after that.

 He said the standard procedure after creating exam answers is for the lecturer to submit them to Nanyang Business School&#8217;s exam office, which then forwards them to the university&#8217;s office of academic studies for safe-keeping.

 After that, all hard copies of the answers are destroyed and soft copies deleted from the lecturers&#8217; computers. The next time the lecturers see the answers is when they mark the papers.

 Said Prof Vijay: &#8216;I&#8217;ve been with the school for more than 10 years and all lecturers have followed this procedure conscientiously. This is the first time such a situation has arisen. 

 &#8216;I&#8217;m glad the students brought it up. That speaks well of the integrity of our students as they could have just kept quiet,&#8217; he added. 

 The two lecturers who came up with the answers for the exam - Nanyang Business School sub-dean for accountancy Wendy Foo, who won Teacher of the Year awards in 1997 and 2001, and Assistant Professor Khim Kelly from the same school - are working with the university to find out how they ended up on the site.

 Those who sat for the exam but were not aware some course-mates had the answers, took the news in their stride.

 Mr Ng Teck Loong, 22, who did not have the answers, said he was prepared to retake the exam, which counts for 50 per cent of his grade.

 &#8216;It would be unfair to count the grades for the original paper now this has happened,&#8217; he said.

 One of his course-mates, who declined to be named, said he would rather concentrate on next week&#8217;s papers. </blockquote>
