  <div class="entry-content"><p>After two weeks of dilly dallying, I finally managed to finish up the redesign that I have been itching to do for the past two months. The <a href="http://nimbupani.com/colophon">colophon</a> gives you an idea of the technical aspects of redesign.</p>

<p>As you can see all the categories have vanished for good. They didnt make sense anyway. I am proud of the use of php and css for the active links that you see on the left, possibly I might even write down a tutorial!</p>

<p>I also used <a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=RoundedCorners">Rounded Corners</a> for the rounded rectangle you see. It isnt perfect. No solution suited my requirements well as my design does not have a plain background like the rest of the solutions.</p>

<p>As of now, the site is compliant with XHTML 1.0 strict, CSS and Section 508. Hopefully, the <a href="http://www.zonageek.com/software/mt/validable/index.php">validable</a> plugin I downloaded for Movable Type will help to keep it so forever.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started nimbupani in 2003 when two of my <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">closest</a> <a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com">friends</a> started to blog. It was my first attempt at web design and writing. Previous incarnations were consequently slightly uncomforting to look at, but I am glad to say I have looked and learned a bit since then.</p>

<h2>The Name</h2>


<p>Nimbupani means literally &#8220;Lemon water&#8221; in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi">hindi</a>.Nimbupani, is a favoured drink in India especially during the deliriously hot season (which seems to be replacing the rest of the seasons in India). Nimbupani is supposed to be pronounced <i>nimbupaani</i>. Nimbupani is cool, refreshing and revitalizes you for the long day ahead. I personally prefer <a href="/blog/www.indiatastes.com/categories/227.html">buttermilk</a> though. But buttermilk isnt a cool name to give to a website, is it?</p>

<h2>Design</h2>


<p>I am guilty of all the artwork, design that you see on this site. I have hopefully compiled with the latest standards and if the site doesnt validate, just <a href="http://twitter.com/nimbupani">holler</a>.</p>

<p>This website uses <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and CSS for ease of use. The links that you see on the right are a separate PHP page which in combination with CSS is used to hilight the current active page.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>


<p>If you are a Mac user, congrats! You can experience the power of Lucida Grande while Windows users can stick to the pathetic Franklin Gothic Medium. I cant help it if Windows sucks.</p>

<h3>Machines</h3>


<p>Designed on a Mac Mini using trial versions of Dreamweaver and Fireworks MX.</p>

<h3>Content Management System</h3>


<p>I use <a href="http://movabletype.org">MovableType 3.15</a> to power this website. The plugins I use on this site are:<ul><li><a href="http://www.zonageek.com/software/mt/validable/index.php">Validable</a></li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Your Privacy</h3>


<p>Relax, I aint a spammer and I havent sold my soul to the devil (yet). Your information is safe with me (heck! I dont think I will even remember if you left your identification or not!). Relax and write your comments without any fear of Big Brothers.</p>

<h3>Supported Browsers</h3>


<p>This site looks and works the best in Safari or Firefox. You can also view it in IE 6. It has not been tested on Opera, Mozilla, Netscape, Konqueror and the unashamedly evil IE 5.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Exactly my thoughts!</p>

<blockquote><p>Dogs don&#8217;t like me. It is a simple law of the universe, like gravity. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never passed a dog that didnt act as if it thought I was about to help myself to its Pedigree Chum. Dogs that have not moved from the sofa in years will, at the sniff of me passing outside, rise in fury and hurl themselves at shut windows. I have seen tiny dogs, no bigger than a fluffy slipper, jerk little old ladies off their feet and drag them over open ground in a quest to get my blood and sinew. Every dog on the face of the earth wants me dead.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Singapore mandarins somehow manage to keep surprising me with the depths of ignorance of the english language. I know I know I can never become one myself, but the advertisement for &#8220;Share a Meal&#8221; starring the Singapore Badminton Star Susilo always manages to make me wanna puke.</p>

<p>Here is why: They have coined an acronym for milk: Mainly I Love Kids. BLEHHHHH&#8230;.I mean that sounds like a paedophile&#8217;s thought more than anything else! I wonder what <a href="http://mrbrown.com">Mr. Brown</a> has to say!</p>

<p>Pizzahut and Sakae Sushi have long queues of couples (all kinds) for seats which used to be empty just a day before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think for the first time in the history of India cinema we have actors who have <i>acted</i>, a wee bit theaterical but nonetheless it was excellence that was on display.</p>

<p>The film starts with an amazingly touching voice over by Rani Mukherjee with a black screen where she asks &#8220;how long can you live like this? minutes, hours? I live like this all my life.&#8221; (pardon my poor translation).</p>

<p>I wouldnt like to bore you with the story line but I really liked the fact that this film covers some unknown territory unlike any other movie about the deaf and blind.  Nobody has ever asked whether the blind have any sexual aspirations, we assume they have no right to, which is very heartless. But this movie has very poignantly raised that question and left the answer for us to interpret.</p>

<p>I was astounded to know Amitabh Bachchan can act. I didnt know he had it in him to execute this role to perfection. He has beaten all hollywood stars hollow in this movie. I think he should win the Oscar for Best Actor (I know I know it is impossible, but I think he deserves one).</p>

<p>So get your asses off and grab the once in a lifetime opportunity of watching a real good hindi movie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The tsunami is not the only link that connects India and Indonesia, trying to search for a hindi song &#8220;inspired&#8221; by Roxette&#8217;s &#8220;the look&#8221; , I landed up on this site that <a href="http://tamanbollywood.singcat.com/radiofm/adoptedhindisongs.shtml">lists Indonesian songs that are copied from bollywood songs</a>. There is also a link to why <a href="http://tamanbollywood.singcat.com/artikel/bollywood_in_indonesia.shtml">bollywood is popular in Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>So does anybody know which song it is?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my consistent negligence of the gmail invites (I used only two of some twenty that was offered), gmail has had enough of my negligence and wishes me to do my &#8220;duty&#8221; of distributing the gmail invites. I tried to hoodwink the system by sending the invites to random email addresses that dont exist, but the system is too clever for that and didnt recognise such emails as invites =(</p>

<p>So here is my request, if you have been living in a cave for the last six months do not fret, I am here as a generous distributor of gmail accounts! I have FIFTY invites to be given (yes yes 50) . Be good and leave your email id in the comments if you want one.</p>
