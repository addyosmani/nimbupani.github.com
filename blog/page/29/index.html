  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didnt know HTML till I reached second year of University and used to feel insignificant when people used to say as a matter-of-fact, &#8220;yeah, I know HTML.&#8221;</p>


<p>I didnt know it till <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> introduced me to blogging. In fact, my first blog design was implemented by him and &#8220;designed&#8221; by me. I learned it on the way, because I stumbled upon beautifully designed blogs. And luckily for me, they were blogs that loved web standards.</p>


<p>And in that way, I learned CSS and HTML. Good thing I was a newbie and didnt have to &#8220;unlearn&#8221; horrible tables and nonsense spacer gifs (that I had to learn those horrible and disgusting stuff again for a webdesign assignment, is another nightmare to scare you with).</p>


<p>And why should you, as a user, care about standards compliant design? After all, blogger does everything for you! You should, because:</p>


<ul><li><a href="http://timesofindia.com">Slimes of India</a> takes years to load. </li>
<li>Most of the text are saved as images and all you get to see are &#8220;img123-332.jpg&#8221; and the browser permanently hanging there.</li><li>Your favourite site can <a href="http://csszengarden.com/">get skinned like your winamp</a>.</li><li>You see horrible spacers staring at you from the screen without anything else.</li><li>The blind using speech readers can finally understand what you are trying to say.</li><li> Google puts you on top of search results</li><li>Because <a href="http://espn.com">ESPN</a> gives you several times improved experience because <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2003/06/espn-interview">it has seen light.</a></li><li>Your university results will come out much sooner than you would think (instead of &#8220;waiting for http://&#8230;&#8221;)!</li><li>You dont have to blame your roommate for choking the bandwidth by downloading 1GB of pirated CDs everyday (which prevents you from accessing your favourite bandwidth wasting website mentioned first in the list).</li><li>Because I care.</li></ul>


<p>Here I present an <a href="http://keikibulls.com/credits/">awesome link</a> to why Web Standards are critical to web design and how you can benefit from it. Demand it from your favourite sites. Write to them. Beg, plead, hit the sites that do not comply with web standards. Throw away browsers that do not comply with standards - you know well about which one I am talking about! </p>


<p>Your first step starts <a href="http://getfirefox.com">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always had these mixed feelings about people who belong to the Indian subcontinent but not India: Are they us?</p>

<p>Are we, as Indians, different from the Indian kids born and raised in U.S.? Or are we any different from the Singaporean Indians who were born and raised here?</p>

<p>However hard I tried to make them distant and <i>not</i> us, it just kept rising up that they are us -atleast with regards to common heritage. And regardless of whether you possess a citizenship to prove your heritage, it is already in you. You dont need a plastic card to prove it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend was bliss. Saturday, I caught up with a friend from Uni and went painting at the nearby Garden. It was so amazing. Though we scooted at the first scent of the rain, I managed to get the outline of the building. Next weekend, will get my hands dirty with watercolors.</p>

<p>Sunday, managed to not get out of the house the whole day except in the evening when I went to the opening of the new <a href="http://www.nlb.gov.sg">NLB</a> at Victoria Street.</p>

<p>Wow, it is HUGE! But the directions inside were not as clear as other libraries, so me and my friend meandered towards the top floors and landed up at the Hype Gallery! And presto! My paintings are there too! =D They look kinda pathetic because they turned up very different on paper than on screen. Sigh&#8230;ought to learn to optimize illustrations for print!</p>

<p>Looked about the reference section (there are six levels of reference books mind you! And spent a good half an hour playing with the atlas there. Atlases are so beautiful!</p>

<p>Finally got down to the business of looking up for books. Found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425173747/102-9670253-7899337?v=glance">Curtain</a>, Poirot&#8217;s last case (so called)! Yay! Finished reading it today morning. It is inexplicable and unbelievable. Agatha Christie&#8217;s romantic notions got the better of her there!</p>

<p>Bumped into <a href="http://preetamrai.com/weblog">Preetam</a>, who told me <a href="http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/">Rambling Librarian</a> was supposed to have a tour of the library on saturday. Damn! But it seems like he was there on Sunday too! If only I knew how he looked =D Rambling Librarian is the awesome dude who introduced us to the official <a href="http://alcme.oclc.org/bookmarks/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:bookmarks.oclc.org:vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg">NLB Bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>Reached my NLB Loan limit and ended the visit with a drink besides the NLB listening to the acapella troupe, who were sadly singing lullabys.</p>

<p>And if I ever get to be a student again, you know where to find me =D</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, <a href="http://kirubakaran.blogspot.com">Kirubakaran</a> has a <a href="http://kirubakaran.blogspot.com/2005/07/googling-ogling-taste-of-lemonade.html">whole post</a> that summarises my skills that he got to know from google. That is the power of the internet! =D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I completed 22 years of my existence. I do not intend to put you through a reflection of my past but rather reflect the focus to my dear friends Ashwin and Deepak who planned the party =D And thanks a lot to all who attended.</p>

<p>The unnerving part of course is that there were several bloggers than before! <a href="http://nimbupani.com">Me</a>, <a href="http://ashwink.net/blog/">Ashwin</a> and <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> being the original three =D <a href="http://antrix.net">Deepak Sarda</a> was there too. <a href="http://antrix.net">The</a> <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepaks</a> were introduced and were last seen disappearing into <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">ubuntu</a>.</p>

<p>Othes were not so fortunate and feasted on the lovely cake (sorry couldnt get a good pic =() and listened to the music streamed from the ipod to awesome creative speakers (Thanks Ash!). It was decided that we spend the rest of the night playing some blighted card game.</p>

<p>Printed my designs on beautiful glossy papers! OOOh&#8230; love my design ;)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4708833.stm">London bombings continue</a>. People think life is a video game. If only it was.  Terrorists, you can achieve nothing by nuking the whole world away. There will still be hate and anger. It is human, just as it is human to classify and segregate hate.</p>

<p>Fortunate to have Vrush over and click some pics of the house =D Here is a shot of my room =D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I headed over to the First BloggerCon in Singapore around 2 p.m. and was the first speaker in the discussion on Bloggers and their communities. And <a href="http://www.preetamrai.com/weblog/">Preetam</a> asked me to speak about the Indian Community in Singapore and our bloggers meet. A quick 5 minutes of my speech and I was back in my seat listening to <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/">Mr. Brown</a>, <a href="http://myveryownglob.blogspot.com/">Mr. Miyagi</a>, and <a href="http://www.preetamrai.com/weblog">Preetam</a>. I also discovered a few groups that I didnt know about like Barflies and <a href="http://www.campusmoblog.com.sg/group/home.asp?gid=1FEFE3A1-A007-405E-AE5B-63932F3EA256">JC bloggers</a>.</p>

<p>The breaks were almost an hour long, which made me ponder on whether they had anything worthwhile at all to showcase! The next session was on how to be a law-abiding blogger, with two lawyers speaking on copyright issues, linking policies, Creative Commons, etc. The session warmed up then, with people asking questions that were of relevance =D</p>

<p>THe third and final discussion was on technology which was quite lame to think about it, where they were introducing bloglines and flickr to the masses and promoting trackbacks. I really have something against trackbacks as there is NO WAY of stopping trackback spam (except by IP Banning) and it is quite a dangerous thing to include. Wisely blogger does not support trackbacks.</p>

<p>We had belly dancers to entertain us while the stage was being prepared for the party! Er..pardon me, but Belly Dancing is a vigorous and exciting dance not to be performed like a ballet. I guess the dancers were either too drained or too graceful to let everything go and perform with enthusiasm!</p>

<p>The only thing that was jarring was the IRC panel that was displayed on the screens that took away the audience attention from the discussion, leading to quite a few giggles and laughs about the content on the IRC.</p>

<p>The party till the time I left (which was around 9) was not at all happening =D Everyone was gathering around the counter serving the free flow of drinks and watching the NDP Practice Fireworks =D</p>

<p>On the whole, it was a good beginning, I hope the momentum will be sustained and a meaningful discussion about blogs would emerge from the next conferences.</p>

<p>A BIG Thanks to the organizers for putting on an AWESOME smooth show!</p>

<p>One good thing, <a href="http://popagandhi.com/vault/okay-i-changed-my-mind/">Popagandhi</a> restarts blogging! Yay!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My website has taken a crazy lot of hits from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mrs%20goh%20chok%20tong%20nkf">google</a> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=mrs+goh+chok+tong+nkf&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt">yahoo</a> searches for &#8220;Mrs Goh Chok Tong&#8221; and &#8220;NKF&#8221;. I admit I find this whole fiasco very interesting, as if I am present to a significant milestone in the history of Singapore.</p>

<p>It is significant because for the first time in the history of Singapore, we have a newspaper unmasking corruption in a highly publicised charity organization htat has been patronised by most of the whos who of Singapore. NKF is more famous for organizing dramatic risky acts by top stars in Singapore to collect funds to &#8220;help&#8221; the Singaporeans who need dialysis or replacement of kidneys.</p>

<p>And it is even more significant that for the first time the press has openly asserted its power in Singapore.</p>

<p>Run over to <a href="http://tomorrow.sg">Tomorrow.sg</a> for updated blogs reporting on the incident.</p>

<p>P.S. I am attending the <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/07/11/bloggerssg_2005_-_frequently_ask.html">Blogger Convention Discussion</a> Saturday at 2.00 p.m. Be there to share your views on blogging -even if you dont blog!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://ashwink.net/blog/">Ashwin</a> sent me a link to <a href="http://hypegallery.com.sg">Hype Gallery</a>. A click to the site left me curious and a sense of &#8220;could this be for real?&#8221;. And to test it, I uploaded an image I cherish (<a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2004/10/04/about_a_boy.php">About a Boy</a>). And I get a &#8220;pending for approval&#8221; status on my uploaded image.</p>

<p>Three hours later, I find that my image has been approved! You can visit it virtually at <a href="http://hypegallery.com.sg">Hype Gallery website</a> and looking out for something similar to the image in the About a Boy post.</p>

<p>The best part is, I could bring down the CD of my illustration which would be printed and exhibited as a part of the Hype Gallery at the Arts House! Whoopie! And I did! If you are in the periphery of The Arts House, you can see my illustration there from 10.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission is FREE! I havent seen it yet (I went back after submitting the CD) and I am going there tomorrow with great trepidation! Whew! Now I know what it feels like to have your first exhibition!</p>

<p>Update: As <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> had noted, it is open from 10.30 a.m. and not 10.30 pm.!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend, I was a willing sacrificial lamb at the altar of Bollywood Kitsch ..er..crap when I went to Bedok to watch <a href="http://dusthefilm.com/">Dus</a>. Er, I think I must have brought some of my grey cells along, because I caught myself sleeping midway in the movie. A good friend of mine was cleverer and left within an hour of the movie. By the time it ended you could hear the collective sigh of relief at the theatre. Whew! I HAD MADE IT! I can watch a mindless three hour nonsense! YAY!</p>

<p>But the Interesting Incident One happend outside of the theatre, when <a href="http://ashwink.net/blog/">three</a> <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">of</a> <a href="http://nimbupani.com">us</a> were passing by a <a href="http://chetanbhagat.com">familiar face</a>. Deepak was the first to notice the familiarity. And I was the one to vehemently protest it wasnt <a href="http://chetanbhagat.com">The One</a>. But it so happened that Deepak and Ashwin also knew he was in Singapore these days, so it is HIGHLY possible that it was THE one. So I did dare to go to him and ask if he was in fact Chetan Bhagat -which, as it turned out, it was! And I was introducing myself and a little blushing and lost for words, I blurted out  my online home address which he actually remembered =D Double YAY! for that.</p>

<p>So, with my remaining grey cells floating on cloud number 9, I made my way home when I had a horrible realisation that I was locked out! And it was 12.10 in the morning! Then had to spend some time knocking on the doors of the security guard and gratefully getting looted by the locksmith for opening the lock in less than a minute.</p>

<p>Sigh&#8230;life is a mixed bag!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul><li>Character Design is communication of the aspects of a character</li>
<li>Starting Point: Words to describe the character. </li>
<li>Interpret the words as what most people will percieve: For e.g.: a fat person has a round body which is wobbly and fleshy all over. </li>
<li>There are two types of Character Development:
<ul><li><strong>Surface Characterisation:</strong>
<ul><li>Exactly who he/she claims to be.</li><li>Mostly physical characteristics without any thought to his/her mental state or being</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Complex Characterisation</strong>
<ul><li>Whether the character&#8217;s actions are right or wrong?</li>
<li>Most critical to show the mental state or being of the character</li>
<li>E.g. Dr. Otto Octavius in Spiderman. Darth Vader in Star Wars</li></ul></li><li>To create a character, look at
<ul><li>Background</li>
<li>Personality</li>
<li>Status</li>
<li>Physical Appearance</li>
<li>Basic Principles:</li><ul><li>Simplicity and clarity: engage the audience in a particular aspect of the character</li>
<li>Staging: Pose the character such that it shows personality</li>
<li>Color: Bold colors with a limited pallete.</li>
<li>Less details the better!: Check how the character looks in a shilloute and see if it is distint and distinguishable</li>
</ul><li>Look beyond the picture to see what the character is all about</li></ul>
<li>Becoming a Character Designer:</li>
<ul><li>Observe: shape, height, sex, race, attractiveness, clothing, cleanliness, facial hair, age, weight, stance, language, movements</li>
<li>Remember what you see: The visual clues. Create exaggerated sketches out of the unique characteristics</li></ul>
<li>Stereotypes:
<ul><li>Hero:
<ul><li>Square jaq/chin</li><li>Slender</li><li>Great mobility</li><li>Muscular</li><li>Strong Chin</li><li>Muscular</li></ul></li>
<li>Gaunt:
<ul><li>Resembles a skull</li><li>High cheek bones!</li></ul></li>
<li>Beefy:
<ul><li>Broad Shoulders</li></ul></li></ul>
