  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like all middle-class Tamil children, I was also forced to learn classical music and dance. Thankfully, my parents did not press on with the dance classes (given all the expenses it involved) but my mom remained firm in her resolve to put me through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">Carnatic Music</a> classes.</p>

<p>I learnt music for about 8 to 9 years, learning to sing and play the Veena (very badly I must say). Needless to say, it was not an experience I enjoyed until the last two years when my awesome teacher introduced me to the science and rules of the music I was learning.</p>

<p>The best part about Carnatic music, I feel, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragam_Thanam_Pallavi">scope for experimentation and play</a> that it permits. Professional artists spend hours every day, in addition to practicing timeless music pieces, experimenting within the rules of each raga those music pieces were set in.</p>

<p>It is this idea of play, or experimentation that seems missing in popular music, or even live non-jazz music played across all bars. From my limited experience, most bands seem to play a set list of songs, but no time is allocated to experiment.</p>

<p>When I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baaba_Maal">Baaba Maal</a> in Cambridge this May, I was floored by how much of the music seemed impromptu. Today, I am listening to <a href="http://www.deezer.com/en/music/habib-koite/foly-69063#music/habib-koite/foly-69063">Habib Koité&#8217;s live recordings</a>, and the same spirit of play is obvious.</p>

<p>Bela Fleck&#8217;s <a href="http://www.throwdownyourheart.com/">Throw Down Your Heart</a> is also a fantastic experimentation and exploration of Banjo&#8217;s roots in Senegal/Gambia/Mali/Uganda/Tanzania.</p>

<p>This also ties well with <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/paula_scher_gets_serious.html">Paula Scher&#8217;s talk on Serious Play</a>. I like to think Carnatic and West African Music are some of the few disciplines that actively advocate Serious Play.</p>

<p>Seeing people indulge in Serious Play, is an inspiring experience. It seems so simple, but at the same time so profound. I think it also explains the popularity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">Improvisational Theatre</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_poetry">Performance Poetry</a>.</p>

<p>I do hope you get to see the performances by some of these <a href="http://nimbu.in/mblax/">West African artists</a>! It is an experience worth having!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am an SVG fanatic, in fact I was using SVG for implementing my final year project (which was to create a GPS system on a linux mobile device) in 2000. So yes, I am partial to SVG and cannot <a href="http://nimbupani.com/search/node/svg">stop writing about it</a>.</p>




<p>I have long bemoaned the persistent <a href="http://nimbupani.com/the-final-coming-of-svg.html">lack of love for SVG from browser vendors</a> but these developments indicate that is no longer the case: </p>




<ol>
    <li><p>HTML spec allows inline SVG in your HTML document (and not just XHTML document). This means <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/#mathml-svg">you can use an SVG element inline an HTML document</a> (without using any ugly object tags). You can already test it on the <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">nightly builds of Firefox</a></p></li> 
    <li><p>Apple&#8217;s retina display brought back attention to this <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/55/high-dpi-web-sites/">old post on how to develop websites for higher DPI</a> – which basically advocates SVG (<a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> also tells me <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1376">a future release of Android will support SVG</a>). </p></li>   
    <li><p>@media queries are extensively supported in several browsers. Andreas Bovens of Opera has a great technique to <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2009/10/12/how-media-queries-allow-you-to-optimize-svg-icons-for-several-sizes">use media queries with SVG</a> which he explains in this video:</p><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YAK5el8Uvrg&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YAK5el8Uvrg&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xd0d0d0&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"; type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
    <p>You can control the styles of the SVG file that referred to by an image element, based on the width specified on the image element (see demos of <a href="http://people.opera.com/andreasb/demos/demos_svgopen2009/circles.html">colored circles</a>, <a href="http://people.opera.com/andreasb/demos/demos_svgopen2009/svgscalelogo.html">scaling SVG logos</a>, and <a href="http://people.opera.com/andreasb/demos/demos_svgopen2009/svgscalegold.html">altering SVG charts</a>. </p> 
<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://schepers.cc/">Shepazu</a> has rightly stated CSS Media Queries work on Firefox, Webkit and Opera, not just Opera (for some reason the colored circles demo only seems to show in Opera).</p>
</li>                                     
<li><p><a href="http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html">SVG-Edit</a> is a fantastic open-source online SVG editing platform (it is new and the UI needs some love), especially for tiny icons. 
</p></li>
<li>Opera, Webkit browsers recognize SVG images served as <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/952/svgdatauri.html">data-uris for use as background images</a>. 
</li>
</ol>


<p></p>

<p>I am glad things are looking up for dear SVG. What was that <a href="http://nimbupani.com/bit-of-svg-and-canvas.html">Canvas thing</a> you were talking about?</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://nimbupani.com/search/node/ecmascript%20OR%20%22javascript%20n00b%22">learning JavaScript</a> and I detoured into learning jQuery. My intention is to learn jQuery by developing plugins :D This way, it would be a practical understanding of how to use jQuery and the experts among you might help me out by pointing out what could be made better.</p>




<p>The first plugin I created replicates the much despised marquee effect. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter homepage</a>, marquee is all the rage these days. Twitter marquee looks good because the width of the text in the marquee is longer than the marquee viewport (and the scroll is continuous). But when you use a CMS, you can never be certain of the width of the text that scrolls in the marquee. Sometimes, it is just a single line of text that is smaller than the marquee viewport, and at other times it is longer than the marquee viewport.</p>




<p>So, this plugin accommodates for both cases. If the width of all the elements that scroll are less than the width of the marquee, then it uses the normal marquee behavior.</p>


<p></p>

<p>You might ask me why I did not use webkit&#8217;s marquee element. This is because <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/obsolete.html">marquee is officially obsolete</a>. I have no intention of bringing it back just because webkit supports it (<a href="http://itpastorn.blogspot.com/2010/07/no-browser-supports-html5-yet-part-1.html">webkit fanboys should read this rant</a>)!</p>


<p></p>

<p>There are also a bunch of options for you: adjust the width of the marquee view port, slow down or speed up the marquee, . You can even use your own class name for each instance to change how the fade looks.</p>


<p></p>

<p>If this all sounds <a href="http://www.google.com/dictionary?source=translation&hl=en&q=sinnlos&langpair=de|en">sinnlos</a>, go see the <a href="http://nimbu.in/weemarquee/">demo page now</a>. If you are a kind person who is also an expert in jQuery do comment on how I can improve it. Also, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A6mon_(His_Dark_Materials)">dæmon</a>, Mr.Claws hides within that page, click away and find him!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/css3vignettes/"><img src="http://nimbupani.com/files/vignette.png" alt="vignette.png" border="0" width="604" height="331"> </a></p>

<p><a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> (why nobody else sends me such awesome stuff beats me), showed me yet another <a href="http://chris-armstrong.com/">CSS3/HTML5 website</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<p>What is interesting is, the site author uses 4 empty divs to create the vignetting effect on the four corners of the viewport. I thought it would be a good use of box-shadow property to recreate the same effect, minus the 3 extra divs (<a href="http://sickdesigner.com/index.php/2010/html-css/css3-vignette-a-wicked-cool-technique/#comment-231">I am not the first to think of it</a>).</p>




<p>The caveat is, the CSS3 <code>box-shadow</code> property slows down webkit browsers considerably. So, until <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22102">this bug is resolved</a> this demo will only work on non-webkit browsers like Opera 10.5x, Firefox 3.5+ (IE 9 Platform Preview claims <code>box-shadow</code> support, but this demo does not render box-shadows there).</p>


<p></p>

<p>You could use the same technique to add vignetting to images. Here is how: </p>




<ol>
    <li><p>In your HTML document, add a wrapper element to the image, I have this: </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;p class=&quot;vignette&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><p>In your CSS file, add this:</p>

    <pre><code>p.vignette {
  position: relative;
}
p.vignette img {
 display: block;
}
p.vignette:after {
 -moz-box-shadow: inset 0 0 10em #666;  
 -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 10em #666;   
 box-shadow: inset 0 0 10em #666;
 position: absolute;
 top: 0;
 left: 0;
 width: 100%;
 height: 100%;
 z-index: 2;
 content: "";
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>content: ""</code> is essential to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#content">make sure the pseudo-element is generated</a>. <code>z-index</code> positions the pseudo-element above the image.</p> 
</li>
<li>
    <em>Die Ende!</em>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Yes, I do wish webkit would hurry up and fix those horrible box-shadow bugs. Till then, you can indulge with me in this fantasy and <a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/css3vignettes/">view the demo</a> :) </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to be reading more and more Manga comics. I am in the middle of three manga series and they all are fantastic (Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service, Psycho, and Pluto) and I regret not reading manga comics earlier. I recommend all of these series! </p>


<p></p>

<h3>Pluto Vol 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</h3>


<p>I am a new fan of manga comics, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1421519194?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1421519194">Pluto</a> has sucked me in unlike any other graphic novel/comic. This is the first Manga series I have completed, and I could not stop thinking of the future imagined in Pluto. I am amazed at how Naoki Urasawa has weaved a beautiful web around murder mysteries, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboethics">Roboethics</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">transhumanism</a>. That it is an adaptation of an arc of Astroboy only makes it better. Anyone who sniggers at Manga comics needs to be pointed to Pluto, just to show how engrossing they can be!</p>




<h3>We Wish to Inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families: Stories from Rwanda</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374286973?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0374286973">We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda</a> is a heart-wrenching narration of the Rwandan genocide. Unlike similar books of this genre, Philip Gourevitch also informs us about the crimes committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (ruling party of Rwanda). Philip Gourevitch is brutal in his assessment of the inadequacy of the United Nations and the deliberate inaction on part of United States. The existence of genocide criminals like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Ruggiu">Georges Ruggiu</a> seems to validate that view. </p>




<h3>Essential Iron Man</h3>


<p>I am amazed how close the movie is to the comic book. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134646?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0785134646">Essential Iron Man, Vol. 1</a>. So, instead of Vietnamese villains we have Arabic ones. Though, Iron Man comics are definitely more mushy (and sexist) than what the movie portrays, and hence, not that interesting (in one of the stories, Stan Lee pleads with the reader to stay with the comics despite reading like a romance novel).</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Dreamer</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563896788?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1563896788">The Dreamer</a> is an autobiographical graphic novel about Will Eisner&#8217;s struggle as a comic artist. It is a good story, but I am pretty sure success did not come as simply as it is narrated. I liked <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-reviews-for-june-2010-part-1.html">The Contract with God</a> better. </p>




<p>I have a bunch of dreary books to finish, so off I go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It took me 2 weeks to get over jet lag from my marathon India trip. So, there are less books to review as I was finally sane enough to do other stuff :) </p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li><h3>Chameleon Days</h3>
    <p>This is the narration of the author&#8217;s childhood experiences growing up in Ethiopia as a son of evangelist parents. It was an engrossing read which also describes some of the work that evangelical missions do. No, it did not alter my perspective of religious evangelism. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618658696?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0618658696">Chameleon Days: An American Boyhood in Ethiopia</a> certainly did not convey anything interesting about Ethiopia either.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Arrival</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439895294?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0439895294">The Arrival</a> is the first wordless Graphic Novel I read. The novel is set in a fantasy world where a man leaves his family to seek his fortune in a strange city. I am amazed at how many thoughts about belonging, culture and immigration that Shaun managed to convey without using any words. If you are an immigrant, you would love &#8220;reading&#8221; The Arrival.</p>        
    </li>                               
    <li>
        <h3>The Complete Crumb Comics, Vol. 17</h3>
        <p>This is my attempt at reading all works by Robert Crumb, the fantastic comic book artist. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560975377?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1560975377">The Complete Crumb Comics, Vol. 17: Cave Wimp</a> is funny and irreverent like the cover promises.</p>       
    </li>      
    <li>
        <h3>Designing the moment</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321535081?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321535081">Designing the Moment: Web Interface Design Concepts in Action</a> is a book by Robert Hoekman Jr. who spoke at An Event Apart Seattle 2009. Most of it seems &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to me, but I know many people might not think so.</p>       
    </li>
</ul>


<p>As usual, here is a plea for you to recommend interesting books you read recently!</p>

<p>Two years ago, I went about deliberately learning about the <a href="http://nimbupani.com/stalking-africa-online-part-1.html">African continent</a>. While prowling around for African music, I fell in love with West African music <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlTR1m74GSs">at first sight</a> (er, note?) I haven’t found a good way to track where these artists will be performing live (<a href="http://songkick.com">Songkick</a> comes close).</p>


<p></p>

<p>So here it is, a <a href="http://nimbu.in/mblax/">West African Music Events Tracker</a> that tracks some of my favourite West African musicians on tour: Angelique Kidjo, Habib Koite, Salif Keita, Baaba Maal and more.</p>

    <li>I used <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=4a36fa375210cb11ff4cd7aa29caca51">Yahoo pipes</a> to create a JSON feed, from their Myspace, official websites and Facebook pages, which is then rendered into the table. </li>
    <li>This site was created using the <a href="http://github.com/paulirish/frontend-pro-template">HTML 5 Boilerplate</a>. It is a project by Paul Irish that I am contributing to, which should be released soon. </li>
    <li>If it is not obvious, the site uses all the fancy CSS3 properties: outlines, offsets, multiple columns, text-shadows, and advanced selectors. This was also the first time I used fonts from <a href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">Google’s Font Directory</a> using their <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader.html">WebFont Loader</a>. </li>
    <li>I have also used <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">@media CSS queries</a> to adjust the look of the site for different widths, which means if your screen is less than 800px then the site will look different. You can also see it in action if you resize the browser. </li>
</ol>




<p>I hope to soon add more events from <a href="http://songkick.com">Songkick</a> using their <a href="http://songkick.com/api/">API</a>. If you have any other artists to suggest (or anything to improve upon), please do! </p>


<p></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the source files of the website (including the PSD files) are available at <a href="http://github.com/nimbupani/mblax">github.com/nimbupani/mblax</a> Feel free to use elements of the website as you see fit! </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul Irish</a> showed me <a href="http://dev.ajcates.com/tests/wrap-shadow/test.php">this implementation of CSS3 drop-shadows</a>. The demo only works for webkit based browsers (though it will work on Firefox if the appropriate vendor-prefixes are added to the stylesheet). </p>




<p><a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/css3-drop-shadows.html"><img src="http://nimbupani.com/files/drop-shadow_1.png" alt="drop-shadow.png" border="0" width="501" height="262" ></a></p>




<p>I first noticed this kind of drop-shadow on <a href="http://aspire2enquire.typepad.com/aspire_to_enquire/2009/08/mike-matas.html">Mike Matas&#8217;s old website</a>. Looking at the CSS for the CSS3 implementation of the drop-shadow (uses box-shadows to avoid the use of an image), there were a number of things that I found missing: </p>




<ol>
    <li>The <code>article</code> is absolutely positioned. It will not work in Firefox if it is not so (the simple fix is to add <code>display: block;</code> to the style of the <code>article</code> element). </li> 
    <li>The method requires a block element within article to render correctly. The CSS for the block element has a lot of styles that I think are unnecessary and complicated.</li> 
    <li>The stylesheet was longer and more complicated than necessary.</li>
</ol>


<p>As an attempt to try a simpler version of it, I came up with <a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/css3-drop-shadows.html">this implementation of CSS3 Drop-shadows</a>. This is what I did: </p>


<ol>
    <li><span class="strike">Add a wrapper around the container that needs shadows. Position it relatively</span>. Position the element that needs the drop shadows relatively.</li>   
    <li><p>Absolute position the pseudo-elements like the demonstration above, except position them behind the main content with <code>z-index: -1</code>, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>article:before, article:after {
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0 15px 10px rgba(0,0,0, .7);
  -moz-box-shadow: 0 15px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  box-shadow: 0 15px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  -webkit-transform: rotate(-3deg);
  -moz-transform: rotate(-3deg);
  -o-transform: rotate(-3deg);
  position: absolute;
  left: 10px;
  bottom: 15px;
  z-index: -1;
  width: 50%;
  max-width: 300px;
  height: 20%;
  content: "";
}
</code></pre> <p><small>Thanks <a href="http://simurai.com/">simurai</a> for better box-shadow values, <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/">Nicolas Gallagher</a> for fluid-layout fixes and further refinement, and <a href=""http://twitter.com/seutje">seutje</a> for suggesting the removal of background color on pseudo-elements!</small> </p></li>
    <li><em>Fin</em>. This is 44 lines of code as compared to 84 lines of code in the original demo and works on all the latest versions of Opera, Chrome, Safari and Firefox. But, Opera&rsquo;s, and Firefox&rsquo;s implementation of transforms are not as good as Webkit&rsquo;s. </li>
</ol>


<p>It is interesting to attempt it for fun, but this is definitely not ready for production use!</p>


<p>Nicolas Gallagher&#8217;s explanation of his fixes is a <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/css-drop-shadows-without-images/">good read</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There were a lot of comics I borrowed as soon as I landed in Seattle. As a result, I have lots of books to review, even though it is only half-way through June. So here are the reviews:</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Six-Word Memoirs on Love and Heartbreak</h3>




<p>This book began as a twitter project, but also includes offline six-word stories. Most are not that interesting though, but some do impact deeply. 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061714623?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061714623">Six-Word Memoirs</a> is a good read for those few six-words.</p>




<h3>Slaughterhouse-Five</h3>


<p>I have no idea why I waited this long to start reading Vonnegut. But I am glad I did finally. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385333846?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385333846">Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novel</a> is absurd and insightful and definitely a must-read. I am amused it gets classified as &#8220;anti-war&#8221;. Apparently, narrating incidents of war without displaying bias makes it &#8220;anti-war&#8221;.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Pluto</h3>


<p>Wow, what an amazing start to a series! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1421519186?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1421519186">Pluto</a> has been adapted from Astro Boy by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoki_Urasawa">Naoki Urasawa</a>. It is fantastic murder mystery. The World&#8217;s top robot-killing robots are being murdered one by one and one of the them investigates the mystery. The manga series confronts the issues of what &#8220;life&#8221; and &#8220;music&#8221; mean to robots and how humans deal with robots that have &#8220;feelings&#8221;. Cannot wait to read the rest of it! </p>




<h3>Psycho</h3>


<p>This is the wrong book to read as I had no context to the plot. I should have begun with Volume 1 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595822631?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1595822631">MPD-Psycho</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Nightschool</h3>


<p>This series is a wannabe Twilight. Avoid <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0759528594?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0759528594">Nightschool</a> if you hate Twilight!</p>


<p></p>

<h3>The Contract with God Trilogy: Life on Dropsie Avenue</h3>


<p>Will Eisner was one of the early pioneers of the art of graphic novel, this book is a great testimony to his genius illustration and story-telling skills. </p>




<p>This set of novels is about the life and times of fictitious Dropsie Avenue that is based on the real-life stories of the places Eisner grew up in. It is amazing, how racism plays out over the years (first Irish vs. Jews, then the whites vs. blacks) and how politics and crime went hand-in-glove. One thing that has irked me about American media is how it treats rampant corruption as something that occurs only in other nations. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393061051?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393061051">The Contract with God Trilogy: Life on Dropsie Avenue</a> and <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2005/05/tosches200505?printable=true">this long article on Arnold Rothstein</a>, shatter that myth. </p>




<p>Hopefully, I should have more books to review by end of June. As always, I welcome suggestions for books to add to <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/nimbupani/books?category=wanted">my queue</a>. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, was that a dramatic month or what! I quit my job, went to India for vacation, had a gala time in Goa/Gokarna and still managed to read about 6 books. I am back in Seattle now. The annoying thing about traveling is, once you start it, it is hard to stop. Now I am itching to travel in the US, but alas, it is expensive. :( You can see how the automobile/aviation industry has altered the course of travel in the US by how expensive and time-consuming it is to travel from Seattle to Portland, if you do not posses a car or are traveling by air. Anyone &#8220;backpacking&#8221; in the US will definitely feel like a 5-star tourist in Asia and elsewhere. I guess, I would have to make do with exploring Seattle!</p>

<p>Here are the book reviews:</p>


<h3>Orion</h3>


<p>When I met <a href="http://www.digeratus.com/">Udhay Shankar</a> in Bangalore, he was cleaning out his book shelves to make way for new books and I scored this book and the First book of Mazlan. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0812532473/188-2191175-7516647?SubscriptionId=0XQXXC6YV2C85DX1BF02">Orion</a> is a pretty interesting story of science-fiction/mythology/fantasy. It tells the story of God-like beings who have evolved from men over several centuries and their attempt to control their &#8220;destiny&#8221; by meddling in the evolution of humanity. It sounds complicated, but it is all explained very engrossingly well (with a romantic side-story to the boot).</p>




<h3>Midnight Tides: First book of Mazlan</h3>


<p></p>

<p>Every page of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0765310058/188-2191175-7516647?SubscriptionId=0XQXXC6YV2C85DX1BF02">this book</a> reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">Dune</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_Cthulhu">Call of the Cthulu</a> mainly for the flowery, fawning prose used to describe the protagonists. If you really love fantasy, you might like this book, but it is not for the mildly curious.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Making things happen </h3>


<p>I am an avid reader of <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com">Scott Berkun&rsquo;s blog</a>, but never read any of his books till recently. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596517718/188-2191175-7516647?SubscriptionId=0XQXXC6YV2C85DX1BF02">Making Things Happen</a> is the newer edition of The Art of Project Management. It does not matter if you are freelancing, or work in a start-up or a big company, every word that Scott mentions is worth thinking about how to translate to your day to day work. What I love about his writing is he attempts to write without bias, and indicates bias when he does think there is one (and not to mention the solid work of references and footnotes). I wish all writers wrote in this manner. My only complaint is, some of the &#8220;failures&#8221; he cites from his experience did not seem like failures to me (maybe they do to someone else in a similar position). This book makes me think Scott Berkun must be quarter vulcan :) </p>




<h3>Universal Design </h3>


<p>I was given <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596518730/188-2191175-7516647?SubscriptionId=0XQXXC6YV2C85DX1BF02">this book </a>by Matt May (and I had him sign it in Arabic :) It is a very short book, that you can quite possibly read within a hour or so. The trouble with technical books, such as this one, is that by the time it gets published, it goes out of date. The authors have tried to mitigate it somewhat, but unfortunately, web standards are in a constant state of flux. </p>


<p>All the examples use the XHTML Strict doctype, though I would have appreciated if a rationale was given why they went with it. This slim book, also has code examples that are two pages long, which are best shared online than on paper (and probably could have been used to explain ARIA more?). I also think, a book about Universal Design, could also have covered a bit on RDFa or Microdata.</p>


<p></p>

<p>This is a good book for anyone who has this question &ldquo;WTF is Accessibility?&rdquo;, but I do not think it addresses anything beyond that. I wish it did though.</p>




<h3>Ruskin Bond&rsquo;s Book of Humour</h3>


<p>It is a collection of essays and articles by Ruskin Bond about his life in Landour. Some of these are outrageous (like when he describes seducing a teenage girl) but somehow it all sounds normal when he describes them. There is, as always, an underlying thread of melancholy for times that have gone by. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/014306343X/188-2191175-7516647?SubscriptionId=0XQXXC6YV2C85DX1BF02">This book</a> is a good read on a lazy sunday afternoon, when your thoughts turn towards the good times you had as a school-going kid. </p>




<h3>The Story of Our Food </h3>


<p>This is a very thin book, and I should warn you that <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/story-our-food-achaya-book-817371293x">the book</a> is literally what the title says - a story. The book feels like one of those stories your annoying grandpa has the habit of narrating just when you have something important to work on (and you feel guilty for not listening). It has some interesting insights about how the staple food of India came about, but unfortunately there are no footnotes or references for any of the statements he makes. Thankfully, there is a set of 10 reference books at the end which should likely throw more light on the history of Indian cooking.</p>
