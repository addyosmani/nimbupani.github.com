  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com">Bowling for Columbine</a> was a refreshing change from the paranoia of studies. I was amazed that an American would actually be critical about American policies. I had almost given up on them as citizens of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451524934/002-7906027-7491267?v=glance">Oceania</a>. But they aren&#8217;t that bad yet I guess.</p>

<p>The best part of the film was <a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/library/wonderful/index.php">the Wonderful World</a>, which lists America&#8217;s consistent hypocritical position as a leader of the oppressed and the leader of &#8220;Human Rights&#8221;.<a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/library/wonderful/iran.php">This item in the list</a> is about the Iranian conspiracy by CIA that led to the assasination of the democratically elected <a href="http://www.irannationalfront.org/Mossadegh/">Mossadegh</a> and the restoration of the Shah&#8217;s oppressive regime. All this for precious Arab oil.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16554">This</a> review, of a recently published  book unearthing CIA&#8217;s role in the conspiracy, is quite comprehensive and  gives a good idea of how the image of America as &#8216;anti-colonialist&#8217; was shattered with the assasination of Mossadegh. Its <a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1989530">relevance</a> should not be lost on us.</p>

<p>This is my newly decorated softboard. I would love to claim all the beautiful paintings that you can see as my masterpieces, but I would rather give the masters and C.R.Y the credit. These are the <a href="http://www.cry.org/home/crycards/crycards.asp">C.R.Y Cards</a> that I found too good to resist.  At the right bottom, you can see <a href="http://nimbupani.com">this</a> devil being propped up by the Mother. Of course, to the left of that you see my Hero- my Grandpa (its truly my grandpa&#8217;s picture and not a shot from some Hollywood war movie).  In case you are wondering about the toothless oldie, he is the result of my first experience with a stylus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I go any further, I must explain how the core of any country&#8217;s economy runs around Banks. Banks accept deposits (bank accounts, fixed deposits) from not just the local residents (in local currency), but also from international institutions (which are called ?Loans? (in U.S Dollars)). The Banks also lend money to small borrowers (like you and me) and to the big borrowers like Industries. Banks PAY a lower interest rate (individually, we own just a mere 0.02% of total Bank&#8217;s cash trading volume) but CHARGE a high interest rate from industries (as they give away loan in millions). The industries must pledge some assert as collateral (the bank acts like a pawn broker!). So the banks must be careful about whom they loan the money to.</p>

<p>Banks make money from the difference in the interest rates and also by providing other services (for which they charge a &#8216;small(!) fee&#8217; from the depositors). Banks remain in business even in case of emergencies only because of the mismatch of the time periods of borrowing and lending. Banks accept long term deposits (most of our deposits are long term and can&#8217;t be closed soon after opening a bank account). Banks lend money to Industries for a short term (say a year or six months). So, with stable lending, banks will generally always have sufficient money to meet the needs of any emergencies (panic closure of accounts by individual depositors, war etc.).</p>

<p>A Bank&#8217;s &#8220;assets&#8221; are the loans it gives to various companies. If they become &#8220;bad&#8221;, they turn into Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). &#8220;Bad&#8221; means, the company fails to return the Principal and the interest or fails to pay the monthly interest or makes heavy losses and hence is unable to return the money.</p>

<p>In Asian Economies, banks have always been under Government control. The industries that the banks should favour, the interest rates that they should charge and the maximum amount they can lend are all fixed by the Government. In such tight Government control, foreign industries find it hard to get loans in local currency, which is why there is such a clamour for deregulation and liberation of the Finance Markets. <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1352899">IMF had always been a staunch advocate of deregulation.</a></p>

<p>The Asian Governments wanted foreign investment and, hence, industrial development, to provide employment for their citizens and boost their economic growth. Hence, following the IMF&#8217;s deregulation drive, East Asian Banks had more capital inflow (through International short-term loans in U.S Dollars) and more autonomy to decide where these funds should be invested in.</p>

<p>This was the root cause of the crisis. Although IMF had given a vague call of deregulation, there were no proper guidelines on how the Government should play its supervisory role to enable the economy to sustain growth. There were no guidelines requesting transparency in the issue of Bank licenses. The domestic market was undeveloped. Most economies had no short term market in local currency and the industries had no choice but to depend on banks for the loans.</p>

<p>Moreover, now Asian Banks had full autonomy to decide whom they should favour for investing. There was no transparency involved in this procedure. Many scams have recently come to light in Thailand, Indonesia where bank officials exploited the financial chimera.</p>

<p>In 1990s, the property sector in Asian countries was booming. Banks, with great short sight, thought this boom would continue for a long period of time and hence invested in this sector (and other selective sectors). Thus, without a diverse assert portfolio (i.e., putting all their eggs in one basket), banks were gambling away most of their short term loans (which they borrowed in U.S. Dollars) in the property sector. The property prices zoomed artificially with the short sighted estimation of the market demand. This created a property bubble which burst in 1997.</p>

<p>When banks had companies that defaulted on their loans, they had NPAs. The banks started taking over the company properties that were pledged as collateral and ended up with much property on their hands. But, by this time, the property prices had crashed. The sale of company properties could hardly cover the interest left to be paid, leave alone the principal. In effect, a total loss of money.</p>

<p>Property is not liquid (it is not easily converted into cash) and when the time neared to pay off their U.S. Dollar debts, the banks had little or no money left (save the local currency). The banks had no way to raise money from the citizens (through the issue of stocks or <a href="http://economics.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-bond.htm">bonds</a>) as the Governments did not develop a short term market for local currency. The Companies could not raise money either. Smaller companies, which depended on these big companies, started defaulting on their loans too. So, the banks had a pool of NPAs and they themselves were on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Thus, due to the concentration of the investments of ALL banks in a select few sectors, the domestic financial systems of Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand were on the verge of collapse. Singapore did not deregulate rapidly and strict government control still exists, but many Singapore banks suffered a loss as their investments were mostly in the East Asian Region. <a href="http://www.accenture.com/xd/xd.asp?it=enweb&xd=ideas%5Coutlook%5C6.99%5Cover_banking.xml">One bank (Tat Lee Bank) was merged with another (Keppel)</a>. Tat Lee Bank had suffered major losses as most of its investments were in Indonesia.</p>

<p>India did not get affected at all, even though she had just opened up the market for foreign investors. <a href="http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Rising_to_the_Challenge/India/indi-mac.pdf">[PDF] There was no move towards rapid deregulation., as Indian public servants had foreseen the catastrophe that would be caused by such rapid deregulation without having a strong domestic structure in place</a>. Indian Government facilitated the creation of a market for raising money through bonds and stocks in Indian Rupees <b>even before the Asian Financial Crisis happened</b>.</p>

<p>My salute to the Indian Mandarins! :)</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I do not claim all this to be true and the ONLY explanation for the Crisis. This is just MY vague overall understanding of the Crisis&#8230; I have at least six more weeks with the Asian Financial Crisis! For all you know, I might do an about turn on my views on IMF ;)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And how do blogs &#8216;die&#8217;?
The comment above, believes that blogs exist as shortcuts to e-fame. But really, blogs are pages for your personal expression and for a few others who matter. A blog may be like your kid&#8217;s first sketch of Mickey Mouse thats framed in your drawing room. Come what may, you wouldnt like to throw the &#8216;masterpiece&#8217; out of your room. Creations which others view with disdain but which you are extremely proud of. A blog can&#8217;t die unless the owner wants it to. Sometimes, blogs are like online personal diaries. Blogs provide a personal perspective to the world&#8217;s happenings. You can&#8217;t not read what a guy from Afganistan has to say about Talibans (more interesting if he turns out to be one of them) or what an Iraqi has to say about Americans. Moreover, you get to hear the real story. From the horse&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>I would like to believe that blogs exist for the sake of exisiting - a form of personal expression. Blogs needn&#8217;t be &#8216;Blog Portals&#8217;. If they become &#8216;Portals&#8217; they lose the identity of a blog. I guess blog portals would be better off as a Forum with the Moderator being the author of the &#8216;Portal&#8217;. When the personal touch vanishes so will the blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All the best brains of my batch applied to Accenture for Industrial Attachment (its a trend with the best brains of all batches :) ). The pay is too good. Some of them earn about S$2,000 with overtime pay and all that. Most of them are considered for a permanent job with Accenture too- a well paying one at that.</p>

<p>But the worst part is the work. Apparently its slave work. The people I know,  worked only on Microsoft Word throughout their Attachment period :) . And they had very strict deadlines, which meant working atleast till 1 a.m.  But most of them didnt mind coz of the fat pay check. And yeah, its the best way to make pots of money within the shortest period of time! :)</p>

<p>But then, tales are going round about <a href="http://accenture.rediffblogs.com/">how Accenture treats the candidates who apply for jobs, in India</a>-with elimination rounds from 8.30 a.m. till atleast 11 p.m. in the night (atleast for those who qualify for the main interview).  But then, I guess its a way of preparing the candidates for a gruelling time ahead. I have heard tales, from the friends who worked in Accenture, about how people go without sleep for <b>days</b> and spend their waking hours in the CompanyHeadquarters or their offices.  Its not easy working in Accenture. Surely, the message gets through to the candidates with such a torturous day.</p>

<p>But interestingly, in Singapore, I havent heard of candidates being selected for a job (by an MNC atleast) within a day! Accenture Singapore has several rounds of elimination which last for atleast <b> over a month </b>. Wonder why Accenture reserved the on-the-way-to-slaughter treatment for its Indian wing?</p>

This entry is for the others who didn&#8217;t. Right now, the Projects page is getting updated. I have listed only one ongoing project -the one I am most desperate for help :) .</p>

<p>I have been hit by the midnight blues. The nightly urge to do something about the sloppy website I own. Sometime soon you might see this site with funny CSS designs (changing every night), but do not despair, I think I wil recover my senses the next morning and I should be able to restore the site to its good old form.</p>

<p>But so far the urge has only been to fill in the blanks. So, you can rest your fears for at least a week. I am not sure when Miss. Hyde will show her true form. But it will be soon :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Superheroes and Comics go hand in hand. Or so it seems. There is even an  <a href="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/">online database</a> of comic action heroes around the world. It has a few of them from India too!</p>

<p>Comic Superheroes make you the most optimistic kid in the world. Everything suddenly seems possible and there is Nothing To Fear. Of course, it helps that they had a few hidden aces up their sleeves to win over the Evil Men. But they inspire only awe from us all (especially the kids) with their style of standing with their capes flowing in the wind and I-am-in-control confidence.</p>

<p>But I got bored of the &#8216;fight against evil&#8217; theme that each story was based on and so, moved on. But Spiderman was an all-time favourite. Just for the sheer novelty of having a SuperHero with no techno weapons except the use of physical agility and an attractive &#8216;packaging&#8217; ( never seen a better designed Superhero garment ), its a combination too hard to resist!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love Vividh Bharati for its sense of nostalgia. The time has stood still in its case. I have been listening to Vividh Bharati ever since I was born ( both my parents are radio fanatics) and it still has the same quaint programmes -Bioscope Ki Baatein, Chaaya Geet, Ek Pankar, Sangeet Sarita, Bhoole Bisre Geet and so on. It has never been on the wrong side of Indian Morality.  Nor on the wrong side of Unity in Diversity ( they even had a special programme to promote Indian Tribal Music!!!!). All Great Indian Leaders were remembered on the Great Indian Occasions and Id and Diwali were celebrated on the Radio with equal gusto.</p>

<p>If any one of you are as fanatical about Old Hindi Music as my Dad is, you can&#8217;t have missed the <B>Urdu Service</B> of All India Radio which was just a celebration of old Hindi songs ( The presenter is a corpse rudely awakened by some stupid AIR employee :)) and every singer/musician/actor&#8217;s death/birth anniversary meant a soliloquy of that person&#8217;s songs the whole day! Of course, they also had Qawwalis and such stuff ( non-filmi) ( coz its a &#8216;Urdu&#8217; service you see).</p>

<p>Oh, the title of this entry, BTW, is the name of a program I never miss when I am in India. It&#8217;s  broadcasted in the evening, just after I come back from school. It is a recorded phone-in programme, where listeners from anywhere in India call up the Mumbai Recording studio and request a song. The most awesome part is the accent and cheerfulness of each caller.  Most of them belong to the  Great Indian Lower Middle Class, but their innocence and happinesss is most apparent, especially pronounced when they can actually get to speak to their &#8216;Messengers from Heaven&#8217; ( The Presenters, if you still didnt get it ).</p>

<p>There are other programmes too. But the All India Radio was mostly for music and cinema. And for nostalgia.</p>
