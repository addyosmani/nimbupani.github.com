  <div class="entry-content"><p>I do not muse upon life in general. I find it too complex to understand and would rather take it as it comes. But I do get into exceptional philosophical moods when I am in an open space (>=0.5 meters) with only the sky for company. Remember that open space is a luxury that a few of the Singapore&#8217; s richest can afford. But I did stumble upon such a spot beside the Yio Chu Kang MRT station. What&#8217;s more, there are three ice cream sellers at the same spot trying to make money by selling the same types and brands of ice cream(some people never get it, do they?). Obviously, its my favourite spot where my mind is at peace and it tunes into the philosophical questions that grey cells produce occasionally.</p>

<p>Today, with a slab of ice cream between wafers, I watched the stream of people walking past me- some, oblivious to my presence and some wishing they could afford the intellectual stimulation of an ice cream and an open space. I was just thinking how all their lives are instances of a mega reality T.V. Show (someone, with great foresight called life a  &#8220;drama&#8221; in an age without the benefits of Reality T.V.). I was very curious about how each of them lived, their experiences and what they were thinking at that moment. And I realised this is precisely the reason why I watch Reality T.V., to see something that is not staged, to experience the emotions that the participants went through and knowing that it was not a simulated and dreaming of my behaviour if I were in his/her place. For me, the thought that it isn&#8217;t something that is unreal and staged is comforting. It numbs my brain a bit . But I no longer complain of the &#8220;story line&#8221; and no longer say &#8220;this is not true!&#8221;. Perhaps Reality T.V. has made me think &#8220;its not bad after all y&#8217;know! its a wonderful life!!&#8221;.</p>

<p>Being a maniac for drawing parallels, I tried to replace &#8220;Reality T.V.&#8221; with blogs and &#8220;watching&#8221; with &#8220;reading&#8221; and it made perfect sense. I read blogs to gain an insight into the author&#8217;s life/style/work. I also gain tremendous information in that process, no doubt. I read some blogs for the sake of reading. For the sake of curiosity of how the blogger lives/works. This curiosity leads to interaction and most of the times, friendship. I am wowed by some of the bloggers, but many of them who seem to be &#8220;god-like&#8221; to the public are many times more human in their blogs. This in turn comforts me.</p>

<p>Why do you follow blogs?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.aypwip.org/webnote/">WebNote</a> (via <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/">Redemption In a Blog</a>) is an awesome tool. Please note the familar &#8220;orange button&#8221; . So, I can open my notes in any XML (and the other flavours) reader!! Its just about time somebody came up with this application. Soon we will have the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> integrated into it and emails too (already Firefox has this <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=173&vid=331&category=&page=releases">extension</a> to alert you about the mails in your gmail account). And I am presuming all these will be available online (with the GBs of space that mail services are dumping on us). When that happens, life will be one awesome smooth ride.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I have been musing on how to distinguish between real photographs and graphical images printed on photoquality paper in my email exchanges with <a href="http://www.tiffinbox.org">Seshu</a>, I thought I might as well ask you all your opinions on that. I think after <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry2.asp">this fiasco</a>, the issue of authentic photographs and manipulated images assumes more significance.  This will only worsen the <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/oct/23teh.htm">troubles</a> of &#8220;sting operations&#8221; carried out by the likes of <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/mar/13tehel.htm">Tehelka</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, I am wondering if there are any technologies available through which images (hard copy ones) can be examined to find out if they are real or if they are created graphically or altered. I think this might mean, graphic editing tools must comply with a rule such that all images created by that tool will have a mark of distinction which can be used to recognise the image. But this again might give rise to some &#8220;privacy issues&#8221; like those of the DVD players.  Whats your take?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogs may not be mainstream in India yet. But <a href="http://www.mtvindia.com">MTV India</a> has picked this up as a definite cool thing to do. There is a <a href="http://www.mtvindia.com/mtv/mymtv/shows/roadies2/blog.php">blog</a> describing the events in the selection roadshow for the few who will become the MTV Roadies 2. This is a program where some normal &#8220;youths&#8221; will be filmed riding all over India on bikes and apparently doing some cool things. The blog doesnt look that great, but then the recognition of a &#8220;cool factor&#8221; in blogging by MTV is interesting. Perhaps it <i>is</i> &#8220;hep&#8221; to blog? ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First they attracted manufacturing industries in droves with low cost manpower, stable government and very less tax. But as manufacturing industries gauged the even more cheaper alternatives in other under developed East Asian countries, they fled Singapore (very few remain and do not function as manufacturing units but more like Head Quarters).</p>

<p>Then they attracted the financial services industry, with a stock exchange that was better than Hang Seng and that could be used as a barometer of Asian Stocks. But then the Great Asian Financial Crisis and the fondness of Chiinese companies to list their stocks in Hang Seng diminished that area of growth.</p>

<p>They also tried very hard to encourage home grown entrepreneurs with several free goodies. But none of the start ups have become big enough to be listed in the SGC or push up the growth of Singapore, like the Chinese entrepreneurs have done to China.</p>

<p>With the exhausion of all these possibilities, Singapore government is now looking for an avenue to grow. <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired</a> is <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.08/singapore.html">reporting</a> about the zillions of money Singapore Government is willing to spend on Biotechnology. It is evident in the big plans <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg">my university</a> and <a href="http://www.nus.com.sg">NUS</a> have to have extensive research centers and courses to teach BioTech.</p>

<p>It may be Singapore&#8217;s pot of gold. But I seriously doubt if they can sustain this growth for long. After all, it is a developed country with very high standard of living. Once the companies create their breakthroughs they would rather manufacture the products in other countries. Moreover. there are several companies in India, trying their hands on Bio Technology.</p>

<p>So long as the research leads to lesser suffering, the race for bio tech will be worthwhile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get confused when I go to Java&#8217;s website, is it sun.java.com or java.sun.com. Eventually I realised that Java was one of the MANY products of Sun, which I didnt know tilll a few years ago. The fact that Sun is so closely identified with Java shows what depths it has fallen into.</p>

<p>I am not speaking as an expert tracker of Sun&#8217;s ups and downs, but merely as an observer of a torrent of news about Sun&#8217;s mounting losses and its settlement with Microsoft for mere money.</p>

<p>I started following java more eagerly while doing my Final year Project.  By then, I was already disillusioned with the lack of information on Sun&#8217;s website about its J2ME Configurations. Sun was leading the pack in promoting small-memory footprint configurations of J2ME when the whole world was excited about the larger footprint configuration CDC. While the storage costs and volume are shrinking day by day, Sun seems to be following the pooposit path in evangelising the configuration for the smaller devices with lesser memory.</p>

<p>It isnt just that, the Sun&#8217;s website had fewer and least informative articles while I found more compelling articles on IBM Developer. Worse, the forums are scattered with unanswered questions (you can see three of mine if you google nimbupani :)).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everything I wanted to say about the movie, had been said in an unsaved post which was destroyed by the Evil Computer that I am saddled with. But anyways, color fanatics and arty snobs please rush to watch this movie before it dies a silent death. Its way too good. I cant compare it with anything, but it should have won an oscar for its cinematography, specifically only for the blue skies and the creamy barren desert beneath it. I am not wasting any more time on this post, lest my computer gets wise and shuts off.</p>
