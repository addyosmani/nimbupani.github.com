  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spoke about it 2 months ago when I asked Michael Smith of Opera about Firebug and what they have to offer. He did tell me that they are going to have something that solves the same problems like firebug within &#8220;this year&#8221; (2007) - i had no idea it could happen so soon!</p>

<p>Anyways, all you web developers - please download this: <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> and then get this: <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-developer-tools/?page=2">Opera Developer Console</a></p>

<p>Of course, it is all quite shaky still (bad UI and all that). But, I am glad, they have come out with it - soon I can get rid of Firefox forever :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just read this on the <a href="http://www.sensible.com/chapter.html">sample chapter from Don&#8217;t Make Me Think</a>:</p>

<blockquote>My favorite example is the people (and I’ve seen dozens of them myself) who will type a site’s entire URL in the Yahoo search box every time they want to go to there—not just to find the site for the first time, but every time they want to go there, sometimes several times a day. If you ask them about it, it becomes clear that some of them think that Yahoo is the Internet, and that this is the way you use it</blockquote>


<p>This is so true. I was not around when my mum learned how to use the internet on her own - without anyone else to learn from. She used to open the firefox application and the default page was the google start page where she types in the name of the website she wanted to visit and then go there.</p>

<p>Or, she clicks the drop down arrow on the address bar and scrolls down to the page she wants to visit.</p>

<p>Of course, I taught her the easier method :) and the concept of bookmarking.</p>

<p>I have also noticed people who do not know what to do with &#8220;bold&#8221; links - they have no idea that it is a link unless you put the &#8220;underline&#8221;.</p>

<p>The point is, we designers are so wrapped in our own world that it is a shock when you see such people who use websites in shockingly different manner than how &#8220;we think&#8221; they should be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449467/">Babel</a> is one movie that anyone with as much patience as a woman in labour <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449467/">should never watch</a>. In fact, you shouldnt even try to see the posters, or get tempted by the &#8220;beautiful cinematography&#8221;, and other such comments that friends might make to entice you to watch.</p>

<p>I unfortunately did.</p>

<p>I found the story line naive, the fractured sadness of every cast member including the poor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_rifle">Winchester Rifle</a> unbearable, and the mere presence of Brad Pitt intolerable. Sigh&#8230;if only there was a flickr set of the images in the movie, my 2 hours and extra minutes would have been better spent looking at them rather than watching the movie.</p>

<p>I am still reeling from the effects of this movie. I have warned you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not an oxymoron anymore :)</p>

<p>I went to the <a href="http://websg.org/archives/2007/01/woot.php">web standards meet up</a> yesterday and that was definitely clear. There were people working on making sites compliant. What is notable and worth showering flowers of praises are the efforts of people in the system (like Lucian and Vanessa) to make sites compliant and lead efforts to create a community of like-minded individuals. Truly, in the service of the people I say!</p>

<p>Also managed to see and speak to <a href="http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/">Rambling Librarian</a> - and I guiltily thought about how I am no longer painting :(.</p>

<p><a href="http://metacole.wordpress.com/">Coleman </a>managed to get a &#8220;symbol&#8221; for web standards - though it might be disagreeable for some. If you don&#8217;t comply - you are Hitler, if you are AAA compliant you are Mother Teresa!
(you can see where YOU would stand in this <a href="http://metacole.wordpress.com/files/2007/01/continuum.jpg">good-evil continuum chart</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://nickpan.com/">Nick Pan</a> spoke about how he is using web standards in his company for websites. I later asked him on why there were still some inline styles and some tables - which he told me was part of the CMS which their company had no control of. Thankfully, in my few months of being a designer, I never came across a client using obnoxious CMSes which dont validate!</p>

<p>Also present was <a href="http://www.pluitsolutions.com/">Herryanto</a>, the famous creator of <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/">BookJetty</a> - Thank YOU for the most useful app ever!</p>

<p>Now, the plan is to meet at least once a month and get things going with regards to standards. Perhaps, it will also be a good idea to bring along clients, partners, etc who have no clue about web standards and spend the first half an hour introducing web standards before we get all technical and start sharing our work!</p>

<p>I will also be attending <a href="http://www.pebbleroad.com/events/view/css_workshop_with_russ_weakley/">Russ Weakley&#8217;s CSS workshop</a> on Feb 8 as well as <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampSingapore">BarCamp</a> this saturday. Woot!</p>

<p>I forgot to mention, in the excitement of knowing web standards enthusiasts, about the <a href="http://websg.org/archives/2007/01/opera_softwares_web_standards.php">talk that W3C Michael Smith gave on Opera</a> and web standards - which was pretty basic, but I got to know that Opera will have a firebug replacement this year. YAY! Then I can stop using Firefox already!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A short update to my blog that is asleep. I have been working with the terribly nice guys at RealSelf on their portal - <a href="http://www.realself.com">realself.com</a> . And what a nice site it turned out to be!</p>

<p>I was working on the theming and small development work for the portal. It is a huge portal containing hundreds of articles/ reviews and snippets of information on all kinds of anti- aging products, technologies, celebrity gossips!</p>

<p>What is special is it is all done in <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> - which just goes to show how scalable Drupal is for a community oriented site - there is a HUGE community for such products - if you were to believe the number of Anti - Aging ads on the T. V.</p>

<p>It may sound weird, but this sketch actually looks better in the original than through the camera. Guess it is my shaky hands to be blamed!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, congrats to my mums who has won the Best Letter of the Day award from <a href="http://www.deccan.com/chennaichronicle/home/index.asp">Deccan Chronicle</a> for her letter which was published in the City Chronicle this Sunday! Keep writing mums!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/cars/">Cars </a>is an awesome movie.</p>

<p>It is in the same class as every other pixar movie. It is incredible how they deal with a variety of things (toys, monsters, bugs, fish, supermen, cars) and manage to come up on top with each of those, portraying emotions and actions which have never been seen before.  Cars is far beyond the animation that we saw in Incredibles. Each scene is life-like. Small town america has never been portrayed better!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the usual two minute film before the movie begins takes the cake this time. It is beautiful and brimming with innocence!</p>

<p>Watch Cars, you will not regret your ride!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick entry to note that one of the sites I have designed (<a href="http://sapprofessionals.org">SAP Professionals.org</a>) has <a href="http://www.dailyslurp.com/default.aspx?dts=6/7/2006">been selected as one of the &#8220;beautiful sites&#8221;</a> by <a href="http://www.dailyslurp.com">Daily Slurp</a>.

<p>This is my second theme for <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> (the first was for an intranet) and I am just amazed at how easy it is to theme a mammoth like Drupal!</p>
