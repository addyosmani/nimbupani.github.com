  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have created a new group on flickr called the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/stype/">Singapore Type</a> to celebrate the diversity in Singaporean typeface industry.</p>

<p>This flickr pool is a documentation of the historical highs and lows od the typefaces in Singapore and through that also tracks the most popular typefaces today. There are typical designs and typefaces which are solely used for one purpose only ( for e.g. food stall menu typefaces).</p>

<p>I request the armchair graphic designers of Singapore to get up and get shooting! Contribute to the encyclopedia of type design and win the blessings of countless of designers worldwide! =D</p>

<p>P.S. All this is made possible by the new Digital IXUS 50 =D.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was an entry in Tomorrow.sg that made me download <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> and try it out. Boy! It is a MARVEL! I spent two hours locating places I knew in Singapore and finding out how far apart they actually were and how much of an exercise my legs go through and justifying why I shouldnt be doing more at the gym. Try out Google Earth. It is time well spent!</p>

<p><strong>I ponder:</strong></p>

<p>if you could create a flash tour out of google earth from one end of the Singapore to the other! That would be fun!</p>

<p>What about maps for the jurong area of Singapore? I cant zoom into where I stay! =(</p>

<p>Are the maps live? How old are these?</p>

<p><strong>What about creating a community to edit and collaborate on a map?</strong> That would be fun too! Imaging planning a trip with friends and getting to discuss on places through the bird&#8217;s eye view of Google Maps!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85403689@N00/37776054/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos30.flickr.com/37776054_e7d19b8fd0_o.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Fort Green Stage" /></a></p>

<p>I went with Aparna, Anupama and Kanags to pay my first visit to the WOMAD festival in Singapore. Bumped into several friends, known and unknown faces all pouring into the green fields of Fort Canning. I was four dollars short of the requisite S$35 to get in (I didnt realise it was cash payment ONLY -which just simply shows bad management). Fortunately, I chanced upon Himanshu walking up the road and begged enough to get the requisite four dollars to get my magic ticket to nirvana.</p>

<p>The first stop was at <a href="http://www.astarmusic.co.uk/aserebiog.html">Asere</a> where I sat down to give my tired legs some rest, only to get up and dancing for the cool cuban music the band was belting out. Chanced upon some of my juniors and friends from NTU -seemed like an offline version of orkut or friendster with some cool music thrown in!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85403689@N00/37775994/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos24.flickr.com/37775994_fdf63ac685_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Asere" /></a></p>

<p>Found Aparna finally and managed to get front grass patch for <a href="http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Bill_Cobham.html">Bill Cobham&#8217;s</a> drums. And man, can that guy roll! Whew! I havent heard of solo drumming performances, but he really took my breath away. But as a person with less of an ear for drums and more for string instruments, I got bored and wandered off to Les Yeux Noirs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85403689@N00/37776008/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos25.flickr.com/37776008_5121a9a8a5_m.jpg" width="240" height="164" alt="Bill Cobham 2" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.lesyeuxnoirs.net/">Les Yeux Noirs</a> is a french band that is committed to popularising gypsy music. And has two cooote brothers as the violinists/vocalists with drums, cello (pronounced by the lead as <em>&#8220;chello&#8221;</em>) and a santoor successor <a href="http://www.santoor.com/cimbalom.html">Cimbalom</a>(it did sound like Santoor but slightly arabic).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85403689@N00/37776041/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos24.flickr.com/37776041_7a476061fb_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Santoor's Successor" /></a></p>

<p>The lead singer/violinist (Eric Slablak) sounded annoyed when he asked us why we didnt tell him that they were going offtune =D That just KILLED ME! Where in the world can you get to see such committed musicians! That alone made my S$35 well spent! They were performing songs from their new album which was mostly romanian gypsy songs with a few russian ones. The russian gypsy songs are more nostalgic and slow. I remembered thinking when they were singing the russian number that this is the song that will play in the background of my funeral when I die, so that even the small spots of joy that creep in will run away scared to death of sadness!</p>

<p>The next stop was at this Argentinean guy with a french band who was singing in arabic (or so it seemed), forgot the name of the band but his voice was similar to Cheb Mami and Khalid. He instantly created rapport with the crowds making htem swing to his tunes right from the start!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85403689@N00/37776048/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos31.flickr.com/37776048_8d266c6c1d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Argentenian Band" /></a></p>

<p>The Sri Lankan troup under Ravibandhu Vidhyapathy was exceptional. They had interesting drums and cymbals which on the whole created an environment of rhythm. It was an amazing fusion of the folk and carnatic strains of Indian music and what touched me was how identical we people from the Indian Sub continent are!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85403689@N00/37775612/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos26.flickr.com/37775612_ff13b6de56_m.jpg" width="240" height="195" alt="Ravi Bandhu's Troupe" /></a></p>

<p>The finale was at the Main stage (or so I think) where <a href="http://www.karmasound.com/">Apache Indian</a> made a grand entry with the audience already swinging to his troupe memebers. He was infectious with his energy to dance and his reggae music. He belted some of his old numbers which brought a wave of nostalgia first. By that time it was already 11.30 and I had to leave to catch the last few trains on the MRT -knowing that my legs were beyond any hopes of redemption. And just then, the Apache party started =( <a href="http://dholfoundation.com/">The Dhol Foundation</a> made an entrance with an awesome Bhangra number which I could hear with growing faintness as I walked by.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85403689@N00/37776066/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos31.flickr.com/37776066_4fe8eb5f47.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Apache Indian" /></a></p>

<p>Chanced upon <a href="http://preetamrai.com">Preetam</a> making his entry at 11.30! Also got to exchange notes with the <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">two</a> <a href="http://ashwink.net/blog/">other</a> reporters who had gone to Bruce Sterling&#8217;s talk and thanked heavens for making the exciting choice of going to WOMAD than attending the talk!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whew! That was a tough one week! =( My itch to blog even though was completely absent during the weekdays but I found too many wonderful things that I couldnt wait to start blogging about during the weekend (Which includes fridays for me =D):</p>

<p><strong>My Little Black Dress</strong> Yes! Yes! I did it! It was a vision of thousand exploding stars when I chanced upon my little black dress! And thanks to <a href="http://antrix.net">Deepak</a> (too many deepaks in the blogosphere these days), I could get it at an affordable price! YAY! YAY! YAY! (Er&#8230;I mean, he sponsored 50% of it due to a generous gesture of gifting me a Robinson&#8217;s voucher for my birthday!). I know the occasions that demand a black dress on my part would be very very few and very far between (by that time another occasion draws near, I may actually become &#8220;healthier&#8221; than my LBD can afford me to be!). But in the eyes of the besotted It Does Not Matter. The first occasion I can see coming is the <a href="http://www.singaporewritersfest.com.sg/festival.php?c=1">Bloggers Nite</a>. Do make me feel good by dropping by and saying &#8220;Wowwww&#8230;I want that Black Dress!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Band Names as Brand Names</strong> <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak">AdFreak</a> has an insightful entry on how <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2005/08/what_if_there_w.html">Band Names transfers to Brand Names</a>. I love names as Eminem, 50 Cents, Sting, U2, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Savage Garden, The Police, Bee Gees, and Beatles. Interestingly some of them have been translated to highly successful brand names. As, AdFreak sorrowfully writes, several bands have taken to names that would turn a wordsmith in his grave: &#8220;My Dog Has Hitler&#8217;s Brain&#8221; !!! God help them!</p>

<p><strong>Sketching in Full Swing</strong>The past few days I have been sketching everything my eyes can rest on - Which results in some murky sketches of my friends and unknown strangers. Check out <a href="http://nimbupani.com/portfolio/archives/2005/08/27/random_things.php">two</a> of <a href="http://nimbupani.com/portfolio/archives/2005/08/27/random_faces.php">them</a> in my <a href="http://nimbupani.com/portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
