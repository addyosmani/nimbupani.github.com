  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ex-blogger Deepak, has just now been looted by this company called <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> of S$60, unfairly debited from his account for a web hosting service he did not want (rather called them up asking for a refund as clearly stated in the &#8220;100% money back guarantee&#8221;). All his calls to <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> were not picked up. <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> already debited a 60 dollars for the hosting service, and debited 60 dollars AGAIN today. Clearly its a breach of privacy. I am not sure how <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> got hold of his credit card number. Apparently, they had been sending him mails with some &#8220;Invoice not paid&#8221; again and again to which he had already responded his unwillingness to subscribe to a new plan and declined his intention to pay (Though he should have been alerted by then and should have cancelled his card at that time only, is something smart people like me would say ;) ).  On top of it, they cant even be reached on their <a href="http://kytec.com/contact.html">&#8220;customer services&#8221;</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> has a &#8220;Cancellation Request Form&#8221; (a link to which I can not even open) which a customer has to submit for cancellation to AVOID AUTOMATIC RENEWAL(emphasis mine). The words &#8220;Automatic renewal&#8217; are not used ANYWHERE ELSE tht describes these plans. And the phrase occurs only ONCE throughout the &#8220;terms and conditions&#8221;. If this itself is not criminal I don&#8217;t know what else is! The worst part is the <a href="http://support.kytec.com/?_a=tickets&_m=submit&PHPSESSID=a25e4d654dd2167c4e2f2e2f9560e382">link</a> does not work (nor does <a href="http://support.kytec.com">this</a>!).</p>

<p>So, my very humble request is to anybody living near this &#8220;Stony Creek VA&#8221; (or if thts phony, anybody who can call these numbers from USA during the daytime hours in USA)  to call up the <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> domestic numbers:</p>

<ul><li>(434) 246-3912</li>
<li>(888) 662-8216 x2</li>
<li>(434) 246-5717</li>
<li>(888) 662-8216</li>
</ul>


<p>and alert them to this criminal act, if you ever get your calls answered that is. Perhaps you can try it as a fun game to see if you strike the jackpot. Or when you have nothing to do and are struck in a traffic jam or freezing inside the house. The details to be provided are:</p>

<p>&#8220;Deepak Jois in Singapore has time and again tried to contact you to cancel the web hosting plans. He was not alerted even once to the existence of the Cancellation Form (a link to which does not even work!). Moreover, despite not attending any calls made by him, your company charged him another S$ 60 in an attempt to renew a non-existing plan. Please refund the S$60 (U.S. dollar 35 ) that was deducted on 9th July (Singapore time). &#8221;</p>

<p>Mail deepak.jois{!@#$remove these and the brackets#@!}@gmail.com if you are ever successful in hitting the jackpot. Perhaps he might have a surprise for you ;-)</p>

<p>If possible, I would love it if you can link back to this post and provide greater exposure to the criminal acts of <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a> on all search engines and prevent any more innocent end users from getting fooled by <a href="http://www.kytec.com">Kytec</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two years ago, I discovered that I could almost paint with pastels. I loved pastels coz they were not as messy as the watercolors or poster colors and I had a better grip on them. So from then on, I made a series of paintings. Most of them were at home in Chennai where I think the hot weather is most conducive to creativity ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I watched the first half of this <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/showtime.asp?fodname=20040628">disgusting movie</a>, I have wondered why a lesbian&#8217;s/gay&#8217;s preferences need to be explained with a reason, as if they became lesbian/gay because they had <i>no other choice</i>. Even the movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0116308/">Fire</a> had to explain the lesbian relationship shared by Sita and Radha due to the loveless relationship they share with their respective husbands. And girlfriend takes the cake for outrageous &#8220;justification&#8221; for Tanya&#8217;s &#8220;strange&#8221; liking for women. Apparently, she was abused as a child and hence her dislike for men and consequent love for women! And this is a reason which most of my friends agree with! Why should you look upon lesbians and gays as creatures deserving pity? Imagine the consequences for gay/lesbian rights when they are shown in this light!</p>

<p>Why do Indian movies depict lesbian/gay relationships as if there was &#8220;no other choice&#8221;? Isn&#8217;t it always <i>by choice</i>? In this context I think <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/showtime.asp?fodname=20040119">Chameli</a> and <a href="http://www.indiafm.com/reviews/03/rules/index.shtml">Rules</a> should be given a standing ovation for correctly dealing with non-hetro sexual relationships.</p>

<p>P.S. <a href="http://psyphycom.blogspot.com">Naveen</a> has a <a href="http://pulaprebalakrishnan.net/gay/gayart1_p1.html">link</a> to an article written about the experiences of a gay.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am still suffering from limited internet access. For the first time in some four years. I have gone without checking my mails for more than three days. Sigh.. but I have just got myself a 3 Mbps connection from <a href="http://www.starhub.com/online/maxonline/index.html">Starhub</a> which comes free with a wireless router and a 15% discount on the monthly fee for unlimited access. But the installation of all that will happen only this thursday. So until then, I am totally cut off :(</p>
