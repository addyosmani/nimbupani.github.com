  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, one of the projects I worked on <a href="http://50matches.com">50matches.com</a> launched quietly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/500908851/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/500908851_5fbd69d636.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="50matches.com" /></a></p>

<p>Today, I found, while getting my daily dose of caffeine, that <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">Read/Write web</a> had an article on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/are_social_book.php">50matches</a>. Of course, the article also quotes:</p>

<blockquote>50 Matches sports a clean, unadorned design&#8211; like Google &#8211;</blockquote>


<p>This quickly snowballed, and the next thing you know, its on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us home page</a> and its <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular">popular links</a>.</p>

<p>The simple design was precisely the intention of the 50matches team and me. Coz I think search engines should get out of the way of search results.</p>

<p>The search results are more semantic now too. Sadly the HTML does not validate (but only 3 errors :) ). Thanks to the <a href="http://www.50matches.com/about.php">50matches team</a> for giving me this opportunity!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><hr>


<p>This is the second interview in the series of interviewing Web 2.0 hackers from Singapore. Today we get to see <a href="http://pluitsolutions.com/about">Herry</a>. Herry is a hacker and a designer. He developed the acclaimed <a href="http://bookjetty.com/">BooJetty</a> a social book-bookmarking site that also mashes up Amazon and Singapore National Library (NLB) catalogue information. He talks about BookJetty, what it is like to be a developer and a designer, and of course, the technical aspects of BookJetty and how he gets a project off ground.</p>

<hr>




<h3>What drives you to create web apps like <a href="http://bookjetty.com">BookJetty</a>?</h3>


<p>It was to solve a problem I had, of having to swap between <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg/">Singapore NLB online catalogue site</a> &#8211; to check out if a book is worth a read and if it is available in the library.</p>

<p>At that time, I was looking for a pet project to learn more about <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX</a>, and BookJetty idea popped into my mind immediately. That was how it got started.</p>

<h3>How much time do you devote to BookJetty?</h3>


<p>On average 2-3 days a week, when I got bored between works for client, and on some evenings and weekends.</p>

<p>But at times, work can be so demanding; when I don&#8217;t even have much time to sleep, I have stay away from BookJetty for a while.</p>

<h3>What technologies do you use on BookJetty?</h3>


<p>It was originally written on <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>, using <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> and <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring framework</a>.
But, again, my curiosity for a pet project to learn more about <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby On Rails</a> (RoR), pushed me to go ahead of this crazy idea of rewriting it from scratch using RoR. Lucky me, it went off smoothly, and the database is on MySQL.</p>

<p>Memory caching (<a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">Memcached</a>) was used to cache and speed up <abbr title="National Library Board">NLB</abbr> response, and to save on the server sessions, I pooled the session IDs.</p>

<p>As for the front-end site, the JavaScript libraries, I mainly used <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us">Scriptaculous</a> and <a href="http://cross-browser.com">X-Library</a>. <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>, none other than <a href="http://www.radrails.org">RadRails</a>. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> for the version control, and server co-located at <a href="http://www.qala.com.sg">Qala</a>, running on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<h3>How long did it take for you to get any web app off the ground?</h3>


<p>It&#8217;s a subjective question, depending on the complexity of the application and the platform you use to develop. Using <abbr title="Ruby on Rails">RoR</abbr> will be faster. :)</p>

<p>A full fledged application with testing and administration site done properly, on an average, would take about 3 months. While a quick-off-the-ground
application, can be done in days to weeks.</p>

<h3>How many people currently use BookJetty?</h3>


<p>Currently there are close to 200 registered users, mainly local users, as BookJetty only links up with Singapore <abbr title="National Library Board">NLB</abbr>, but the actual number of users using it could be more, as people don&#8217;t need to register to use BookJetty.</p>

<h3>6. What is the plan for the future of BookJetty?</h3>


<p>To keep developing it into a full fledged social book-bookmarking site, and to link up with more libraries, so as to open it up to the world.</p>

<h3>What challenges do you face in developing for BookJetty?</h3>


<p>The biggest challenge I would say the part that links it up with <abbr title="National Library Board">NLB</abbr>. It looks easy on the surface, as it is not just about passing parameters and screen scrapping.</p>

<p>In the backend, there are some sessions involved, thus the sessions have to be managed carefully, as some may have expired too; and due to the asynchronous requests from BookJetty, there is also a need to streamline and improve the query time through caching and session pooling. A lot more work than what I had thought it required.</p>

<h3>Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently with BookJetty, given the new technologies now?</h3>


<p>Technologically, I think I am on the right track with <abbr title="Ruby on Rails">RoR</abbr>, it is so much joy to enhance the site right now.</p>

<p>But as for the execution of BookJetty, I should have planned it for global users from the start, the on-the-fly call number availability check is God-sent, but would be quite a challenge to implement it across many libraries.</p>

<h3>What do you think you would be doing next? What do you see in your future as you develop for the web?</h3>


<p>I have just spent a few months working on a project collaboration system for a client, so I am thinking of spending a few more months to wrap it up as a product, and hopefully be able to learn something from this experience.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I know about the future, the web is changing so fast. At one moment, you think this is right, later, as you learn, you think that this is stupid. But, at the end of the day, it&#8217;s always about how can we be better off with the web, and people will keep pushing the limits of what they can do with the web.</p>

<h3>You indicated in <a href="http://www.pluitsolutions.com/">your blog</a> that you took a sabbatical to learn about new technologies. How did that help? Is there anyway you think you could have done without it?</h3>


<p>Yeah, there is no way I could have done without it. Other than the technical gains, it also gave me a new perspective to what I believe in and what I want to pursue. The one regret I have is, why did I not do it earlier?</p>

<h3>You are also a rare species that designs and codes. How do you see the relationship between the two? Given that designers are always bickering about developers. Do you think sometimes being a developer constrains your design view (especially on the web)?</h3>


<p>I think the line that separates the two is getting thinner. Now that the basic needs of Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) tasks have been fulfilled, we start to look further; we look at how to do things better, faster, easier, and with more joy.</p>

<p>To push beyond that limit, we need designers with some programming knowledge and programmers who know some design concepts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://starhub.com">Starhub</a> has advertised for long about its broadband 100Mbps pipe (&#8220;Feel the rush of 100 Mbps&#8221;). And given that I work extensively online on servers that are quite remote, this was like a dream come true. I was one of the earliest subscribers to this scheme.</p>

<p>However, since then, I have got much to regret about the service. I have had my modems replaced twice and each time I had to give up working for 2 days - wait for the service man to come and replace the modem.</p>

<p>Today, however, it got worse. The modem just got replaced a few hours ago, and the new modem now stopped working. Thankfully, after much firm talk over the phone with an intelligent customer service guy on Friday (before the modem got replaced), I got them to provide me with the 100 Mbps internet service on my <a href="https://secure.starhub.com/shop/jfn?mfunc=73&octx=47.a0.45&jfnRC=4">Digital Voice modem</a> and this was still available - so I had it moved to my workspace and connected the router from there. So everything works - except for the loss of my landline.</p>

<p>Of course, you can imagine i was WILD. The customer service made it worse when I called after the newly replaced modem broke down. He refused to give me a time by when it will be fixed. He kept insisting the problem was with the signal cable point and not with the modem - but the digital voice cable modem works flawlessly when connected at the same point. I suspect, the problem is AGAIN with the modem - which would make it the FOURTH modem I have got replaced in the space of 2 months.</p>

<p>I think it is the worst service I have got in Singapore so far. And to think I am subscribed to the <a href="https://secure.starhub.com/shop/jfn?entry=PROMODETAIL&promotionId=61477">maxonline &#8220;Ultimate&#8221;</a> which is the most expensive of the lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://timesofmylife.wordpress.com/2007/03/27/giant-robot/">Times of my life</a> has blogged about something I thought was lost after I grew up: Giant Robot.</p>

<p>Even though, this series was apparently most popular in the 70s, it was aired in my dear old <a href="http://www.ddindia.gov.in/">DD</a> (India&#8217;s only television channel till early 90s) in the late 80s - early 90s.</p>

<p>I remember fragments of the series mostly because I remember being scared by the robot and how threatening it looked but also enthralled by fights with godzilla and other mean creatures in Japan.</p>

<p>I never really bothered to find out about it and let it be a show that I once enjoyed till I saw the post on <a href="http://timesofmylife.wordpress.com">Times of My Life</a>. And I cant imagine, for the life of me, why I was afraid of the stupid looking robot (though there is some fun in watching the idiotic actions of the robot). Nevertheless, it still captures my attention - which is why I spent the last half an hour catching glimpses of it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daNYQKb3QfQ&mode=related&search=">youtube</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Starting this week, I plan to host an email interview with the developers of cool software from Singapore. This week, I had a conversation with <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/">Choonkeat</a>.  Choonkeat is an action oriented geek who has developed two useful and popular &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; services: <a href="http://rssfwd.com">rssfwd</a> and more recently, <a href="http://sharedcopy.com">sharedcopy</a>. I emailed Choonkeat to ask some questions on what makes him release projects one after the other and each in a different territory of web 2.0. Here are his answers.</em></p>

<h3>First you created the <a href="http://rssfwd.com">RSS to email service</a> and now <a href="http://sharedcopy.com">SharedCopy</a>. What makes you create such services? </h3>


<p>Identifying that something is lacking in a program/software, finding a simple solution for it and realising that I can actually do it. This is one of my primary joys as a programmer - that I can fire up a text editor just go do something instead of having to wait for somebody else to make it happen.</p>

<p>RssFwd started as a tool that I used until <a href="http://www.meereffect.nl/">Taco Oosterkamp</a> contributed with a support request and dropped me a list of constructive suggestions on how I can improve it. Traffic picked up right after that. Yeah, my &#8220;helpdesk&#8221; literally turned my &#8220;business&#8221; around!</p>

<h3>How much time do you devote to either of them?</h3>


<p>On average of 3 days a week out of my weekday evenings and weekends.</p>

<h3>What technologies are you using on sharedcopy, rssfwd? </h3>


<p><a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2004/11/11/rssfwd-v0-1a">RssFwd was originally written in Perl</a> - the primary scripting language I knew then.  But <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/articles/2004/11/14/rssfwd-v0-2">re-written in Rails 3 days later</a> because I needed the availability of a Web UI but was not able to get Perl running in Apache (one of those days when you can&#8217;t get anything to work!) and then Rails was there whispering, beckoning me, &#8220;script/server&#8230; script/server&#8230;&#8221;. Got me at my moment of weakness. I caved in. (&#8220;script/server&#8221; refers to the built-in ruby web server that comes with Rails and &#8220;just works&#8221;)</p>

<p>RssFwd consumes various feed formats (RSS, Atom), OPML format for subscriptions, XSLT for transforming that OPML to a neat webpage, processes multi-part emails and various languages. Along the way I learnt some voodoo tricks to ensure HTML emails work in obscure e-mail clients, and also how not to be blacklisted as a spam service. As it happens, the Rails way of handling emails is the easiest I&#8217;ve seen, so that&#8217;s a bonus.</p>

<p>SharedCopy on the other hand is a lot of Javascript (DOM and CSS). It is not exactly an AJAX application and I&#8217;m only using simpler mechanisms to get things done. e.g. I use bookmarklet and cross-site scripting (XSS) which is something that is more often associated with phishing and other evil activities. Firebug has been spectacularly helpful&#8230; and oh, SharedCopy happens to be running on Rails, but that&#8217;s the nondescript part of it ;-)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="http://tech.rufy.com/2006/08/mapreduce-for-ruby-ridiculously-easy.html ">Starfish</a> to power my API callbacks feature</p>

<p>All code gets written using either <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. The projects use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> for version control and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> for databases. The services are VPS hosted on <a href="http://www.spry.com/">Spry</a> and <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/">Rimuhosting</a>.</p>

<p>Primary testing browser is <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>. <a href="http://www.vmware.com/mac">VMWare Fusion</a> is used to test with IE6 and IE7.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to get a project off the ground?</h3>


<p>Getting things to work from scratch is pretty exhilarating and is usually completed in matter of hours. If it takes any longer, I would&#8217;ve been too lazy to do it anyway.</p>

<p>But after that, a lot of time goes into learning from actual usage (usually my usage) and evolving the product along. Another big time drainer is the visual aesthetics. I&#8217;m not at the stage where apps looks good right off the bat, but I&#8217;m working on getting there. For SharedCopy, other than browser compatibility checking, I also had to do something not usually required a webapp - website compatibility checking.</p>

<h3>How many people currently use sharedcopy, rssfwd?</h3>


<p>SharedCopy is pretty young, so she only has a handful of people kicking tires. RssFwd has about 29k unique and active users.</p>

<h3>What are the plans for the future for sharedcopy or rssfwd?</h3>


<p>No real plans for both other than &#8220;be useful&#8221;</p>

<p>For <a href="http://rssfwd.com">Rssfwd</a>, features for the end-users has kinda been frozen for a while now. She does as-advertised - nothing more - and a lot of people love her for that. She could improve in performance and monitoring statistics though. And also she&#8217;ll continue to be my playground simply because there is real data and traffic to try things out with.</p>

<p><a href="http://sharedcopy.com">SharedCopy</a> is more flexible and can probably serve a bigger variety of needs, e.g. as an online bookmark, collaborating tool, quick and dirty diagraming, bug reporting, etc. Still at the stage of evolving her character now.</p>

<p><a href="http://sharedcopy.com/public/api">API for callbacks has been just been released, with Basecamp and Twitter</a> being &#8220;bundled&#8221; as examples with source code, so let&#8217;s see what uses come out of it.</p>

<h3>What challenges do you face in developing for sharedcopy or rssfwd.</h3>


<p>A unique challenge of SharedCopy is that the script is hosted in &#8220;hostile environment&#8221;. i.e. the javascript needs to run in somebody else&#8217;s web page (with their javascript). Usually, as Javascript or CSS authors we can pick our HTML doctype (or at least know for certain) and know how it&#8217;ll affect the rendering engine - but in this case, I don&#8217;t have that luxury.</p>

<p>There is not a lot of literature on getting Javascript working in such an environment, hence a lot of the learning is by fire.</p>

<h3>Looking back, is there anything you would have done different with rssfwd - given the new technologies you are able to access now? </h3>


<p>Polling of content takes up a lot of bandwidth and resources. Adopting a more distributed nature would definitely help, especially if it allows a more casual participation of those resources. How? I don&#8217;t know yet.</p>

<h3>What do you think you would be doing next? Wat do you see as you develop for the web?</h3>


<p>I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s not a lack of ideas, but most of them will not be executed simply because I won&#8217;t have a need for them. I&#8217;m very easily distracted, so I only create applications that I need  as that would at least make me complete the project!</p>

<p>Predictions? I&#8217;m not good at it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581809255/uc-20">The Word It Book</a> which is a <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/003240.html">compilation of illustrations done for the &#8220;Word-It&#8221; topic every week at &#8220;The Speak Up&#8221; site.</a> &#8220;Word It&#8221; is a section where people illustrate a word. For e.g. my illustration was for the word &#8220;star&#8221;. And I am so happy they picked my illustration to put in the book!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://tribolum.com">Lucian</a> and his awesome web standards library, I got to read <a href="http://www.cssmastery.com/">CSS Mastery</a> and <a href="http://simplebits.com/publications/bulletproof/">Bulletproof Web Design</a>. Here is a short review of the two.</p>

<p>I completed both the books in a day - which doesn&#8217;t mean the books are thin on content but rather they are both very easy to read.</p>

<h3>CSS Mastery by Andy Budd with Cameron Moll & Simon Collison</h3>


<p>This is by far the better of the two books - in terms of coverage and organization. Andy Budd gives a very succinct summary of the basics of XHTML, CSS, Visual Formatting Model (in 2 chapters) which covers a lot of details that I had not realised about CSS - especially about positioning. I didn&#8217;t know that if you use <code>position:relative</code> on an element, it continues to occupy the original space it was supposed to be in - while it is not the case if you use <code>position:absolute</code> , <code>float:left</code>, or <code>float:right</code>. Perhaps, the fact that I hardly use <code>position</code> is also to blame.</p>

<p>The next chapters each deal with specific aspects of using CSS styling - like background images, lists, forms, layouts etc. What I love about the book is it covers all of them in depth with equal focus on accessibility and flexibility of styling each. There is a dedicated chapter that covers all the different bugs that crop up in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp">IE</a> and the fixes for them. In fact, I didn&#8217;t know the fix for the <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/doubled-margin.html">Double Margin Float Bug</a> for IE. The book shows me a miracle cure by simply using <code>display:inline</code> on the floated element.  Instead of googling around for solutions, all you need is this book by your side to fix your IE 6 woes.</p>

<p>The final two chapters are by <a href="http://www.colly.com/">Simon Collison</a> and <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/">Cameron Moll</a> who take us through a sample page using the techniques we have seen in the book.</p>

<p>The book is a great compendium of tips and techniques that are found on the web written very simply in a manner that is easy to grasp.</p>

<h3>Bulletproof Web Design by Dan Cederholm</h3>


<p>I read this book after reading CSS Mastery and in a way was expecting to see the answers to all my CSS troubles (since it was about Bulletproof Web design!). <a href="http://simplebits.com">Dan</a> had started the introduction warning us not to think of it as the ultimate answer to any CSS trouble. Many of the techniques that Dan covers are already covered in CSS Mastery. Dan spends a lot of time on designing with percentage font sizes which as he says are quite confusing and can easily go out of hand on complex designs and sites.  This book is a good introduction to the designers who are looking to convert from tables based designs to tableless layouts that are accessible and easy to maintain.</p>

<p>For a bulletproof solution to using rounded corners, Dan describes a method that works for static text (or text whose length is known) but does not provide an answer to text whose length is not known - which is more of a common occurrence with the rapid rise of Content Management Systems. As such, this book does not address the issue of designing for sites whose content is always changing and whose width and heights are never known in advance - and that is the major issue that I face in my work. How can I float images (in an image gallery) and expect them to remain floated if the captions become too long and break the float?</p>

<p>In a way, I had expected that Bulletproof Web Design would be the answer for the problems given by dynamic html and content that is unpredictable. But it was a lot more basic and I didn&#8217;t find it giving critical insights in that regard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><i>Cross posted at websg</i></p>

<p>I came across details of a presentation  in a recent Singapore Conference called &#8220;Website &amp; Content Management Strategies&#8221;, organised by Asia Business Forum (<a href="http://www.abf-asia.com">www.abf-asia.com</a>):</p>

<blockquote>Case Study Presentation on Proven Content Management Strategies that can be used to effectively build and operate a web 2.0 portal

Discover the special techniques that were used by NCS Portal City to build and operate an innovative Web 2.0 internet portal that is highly efficient and scalable, supporting collaborative content and mobile access. 
Learn about the opportunities for mashing commercial, lifestyle and government services together to deliver a seamless experience that constantly engages the customer</blockquote>


<p><a href="http://tribolum.com">Lucian</a> pointed me to this URL as the case study site: <a href="http://www.portalcity.com.sg/">http://www.portalcity.com.sg/</a></p>

<p>Now, before all your web trendy people start ROFL-ing, please do note that site is still under construction - at least for public viewing. The point of highlighting this presentation is just to show how web 2.0 seems to have lost all its relevance and has become just another Jargon.</p>

<h4> Is this Web 2.0</h4>


<p>Looking at the &#8220;under construction&#8221; site, it is a glaring give away how not-web 2.0 it is.</p>

<p>NCS is not a company that is in the radar of companies that do Web 2.0 or talk about Web 2.0. IBM, not surprisingly, is.  Which is why, it is a pleasant surprise to see NCS talk about Web2.0. Nevertheless, I think they have got the jargon/Web2.0 movement wrong.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 is about all these:</p>

<ol><li>Design</li><li>Technology</li><li>Business Model</li></ol>




<h4>Business Model</h4>


<p>One of the good things about web 2.0 (which <a href="http://websg.org/archives/2007/03/nexus_2007.php">Nat Tokington highlighted at Nexus</a>) is how fast and quick you can get it up and change it if need be. And how quickly you can get to your customers as well as get their feedback.  Frankly, you wont see any web2.0 sites that are &#8220;under construction&#8221;. Any portal that claims to be web 2.0 are either in &#8220;beta&#8221; or &#8220;live&#8221; - spending not more than 6 months in &#8220;beta&#8221; stage (gmail is an exception! :) ).</p>

<h4>Technology</h4>


<p>Web 2.0 is not just ajax. Ajax is one of the technologies that spearheaded web 2.0 adoption - just like Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><b>Web 2.0 is not about  &#8220;mashing&#8221;.</b> In the description above, the sentence &#8220;Learn about the opportunities for mashing commercial, lifestyle and government services together to deliver a seamless experience that constantly engages the customer&#8221; frankly makes no sense. As far as I know, Singapore government offers no XML feeds (except perhaps the Health Promotion Board? let alone APIs). So, the concept of &#8220;mashing&#8221; doesnt even exist. Web 2.0 is about providing services that enable people to come up with new ones. For e.g. <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>, etc offer APIs which result in pretty creative services like: <a href="http://manishrjain.googlepages.com/flickrfs">FlickrFS</a>,  <a href="http://twittervision.com/">twittervision</a> etc. These create the &#8220;buzz&#8221; around the web 2.0 technology while simultaneously creating a community for adoption.</p>

<p><b>Ajax is not just javascript.</b> I see a lot of websites that scream &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; with just some fancy javascript effects. Ajax has always had <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">XMLHttpRequest</a> component that has been fundamental to the power of Ajax. Without that, there is technically, no Ajax.</p>

<p><b> Web 2.0 is not flash.</b> But web 2.0 is definitely not about using flash to dish up the portal/apps. It has been done before, and they never picked up steam. Portal City, at least its &#8220;under construction&#8221; page, seems to be using flash with some links to government sites. First, they are not accessible, second, they are definitely not web 2.0.</p>

<h4>Design</h4>


<p><b>Web 2.0 is also about web standards.</b> Web 2.0 portals should adopt web standards, accessibility, and usability techniques that work - including design of their portals. Complying with web standards is one of them. In the case of the Portal City, it is obvious that none of these apply.</p>

<p><b>Web 2.0 is about designs that speak of innovation.</b> Now, there is nothing wrong with the NCS portal city page except it doesn&#8217;t speak anywhere of something new and progressive. It doesn&#8217;t have a vibrant, innovative feel and looks like any 90s site (except with a trendier flash presentation). For e.g. IBM is a portal that doesnt say it is &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; - even though they do incorporate web 2.0 technology - neither does it want to be. But for any site that does want to be known as &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; - then it is time to freshen up the designs.</p>

<p>For Singapore examples of Web 2.0 portals we needn&#8217;t look any further than <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">bookjetty</a> or <a href="http://sharedcopy.com">Shared Copy</a>. Perhaps <a href="http://www.pluitsolutions.com/">Herry</a> is the best person to talk about developing a massive portal that uses web 2.0 contructively.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you see this error when you (as I have) been innocently downloading a 2 MB attachment from a client - fear not (or fear the worst) as this is the dumb little <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail</a> that is creating a havoc in our lives. Apparently, they have made a mistake in attempting to solve the problem of spammers and have disabled hundreds of accounts. This is what we get in trusting google (the home of the uber-nerds) to be smart enough to not do such mistakes.</p>

<p>This is where you can get the lowdown: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-ABCs/browse_thread/thread/71546e8e321a3414/99b02ac52e3d5547">Is Your Gmail Account Disabled?</a></p>

<p>Interestingly, there is no account of this mistake anywhere on their site. Wait till one of the reporters get to suffer from it :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was at the <a href="http://nexus2007.com">Nexus 2007</a> event on Saturday and wrote a detailed report at <a href="http://websg.org/archives/2007/03/nexus_2007.php">Web Standards Group, Singapore</a>. Head over there to see my take!</p>

<p>Went for a weird NUS Indian Dance performance - weird because it was a good concept and a bad execution that led me to wonder - what the concept was? or for the matter, what <i>IS</i> dance!</p>
