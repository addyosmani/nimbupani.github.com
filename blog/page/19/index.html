  <div class="entry-content"><p>My unfulfilled wish finally came true today when I woke up fresh, as if I had never slept, at 5.00 a.m. Unbelievable, but true. Even before the nasty alarm clock. And I blame it on an update to the human matrix that the machines are doing.</p>

<p>On a separate note, some movies I want to watch:
1. <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/04/2404/summary.php">X Men The Last Stand</a>
2. <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/62/2462/summary.php">Scanner Darkly</a>
3. <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/51/2851/summary.php">V for Vendatta</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suddednly remembered the great Didi&#8217;s Comedy show that was the ONLY filler ever in DD before cable TV hit us. And <a href="http://tringtring.blogspot.com/2005/10/good-old-dd-days.html">prabhu caught the nostalgia bug before me</a>! Here is a link to <a href="http://www.didipage.de/html/videos.html">Didi&#8217;s website</a> from Prabhu&#8217;s post.</p>

<p>I did like them then and didnt realise it was European and not American :) I love them now, for the quaint 70s-80s look :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last time I was there, I hated it. But then, now that I stayed for atleast four days, I have been enlightened by my amchi-mumbai cousins. So, I can say I hate Thane but I love Mumbai :)</p>

<p>Mumbai is the best place for architecture fanatics like me ( actually, Delhi comes first). The VT is so BEAUTIFUL. It&#8217;s grandeur takes your breath away. No wonder all bollywood movies starts with the overview of the area around VT and Churchgate, before zooming into the hero&#8217;s or the villain&#8217;s shoes (of course, the movies never did justice to VT!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/106070177/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/48/106070177_39bdedbe3f_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="VT Yet Again" /></a></p>

<p>Apparently, there are heritage walks organized for those who are short of time and want to make the most of it. Otherwise, take leave for four days and explore every nook and corner of the city.</p>

<p>I didnt look at the Gateway of India :( But I will when I pass by next. I did have a good look at Kurla where the floods caused maximum damage. My cousin pointed to the &#8220;river&#8221; which flooded the district - a swamp that looks more hideous than coovum. I was wondering how more people didnt die purely from being poisoned by that &#8220;river&#8221;. And this is the state of the river even after the floods. Wonder if the Municipality is listening? Or do they want a plague before they do anything about it?</p>

<h3>Trivia</h3>


<p>My cousin, a train fanatic, knows which train is passing by which station. Not the Mumbai Local ones, but the Gantok-Kanyakumari, Shatabdi types of trains! And apparently, the engines in different Zones also are built differently and look different.</p>

<p>In India, on your mobile phones, you get to see which part of the city you are in, like when i was in the Vashi-VT train, everytime I passed a station the info changed. But in Singapore, we dont have that service at all! It is the very basic element of a location based service :)</p>

<p>Mumbai trains are shockingly efficient. The only trouble being you not getting a seat.</p>

<p>Most people who live in the surrounding districts (like New Bombay or Thane) stay put there. Mumbai isnt an attraction (which I thought it would be!). Each suburb is very self sufficient with malls too!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My dad had carefully saved these two illustrations of mine which were published in The Hindu Young World, twelve years ago. It seems like it just happened a few years ago! I remember showing it to my school principal with a shy embarassed smile and the thumping of my heart as I saw students crowding the school notice board to get a look at them!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nostalgia hides in every nook and corner of my house. As I throw away my cherished books, I remember my school days -the excitement with which I devoured my freshly printed english text books much before the school opened and read them with relish again and again. And every time I read them, the words took flight to become the smells, sounds, words, and people around me.</p>

<p>When a strong wind blows by, I remember the breeze that came through the windows of our newly built classroom ten years ago when I was reading the Non-Detailed Text story of Ruskin Bond&#8217;s exploits with his grandpa. I had sworn then that this is how the utopia where Ruskin lived must be!</p>

<p>The same breeze reminds me of my loud guffaws when my classmate expectedly pronouncing &#8220;nothing! nothing!&#8221; as &#8220;noting! noting!&#8221; when my teacher was going through another story with us.  Sometimes it reminds me of the boring dance and music classes where I fell asleep without fail.</p>

<p>At home, watching the jasmine shrub on the rooftop of the bungalow next door where all creatures great and small sought solace, instantly recreates the experience of &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060110791/103-8692366-2771013?v=glance&n=283155">Games at Twilight</a>&#8221; by Anita Desai which I came across nine years ago.</p>

<p>In the evening, I gaze languidly at the skyline, spotting a kite or two, reminding me of the story of the <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:RA588rulrzYJ:www.getmoremarks.com/cbse11eng1.pdf+%22The+Kite+Maker%22+ruskin+bond&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=6">Kite Maker</a>. Sometimes, I catch the reruns of &#8221;<a href="http://members.surfbest.net/smallwonder@surfbest.net/">Small Wonder</a>&#8221; and remember my dedicated worship at the altar of T.V. from 4.30 p.m. till 6 p.m. watching &#8221;<a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TOS/index.html">Star Trek</a>&#8221; (the original one!), &#8220;Small Wonder&#8221;, and &#8221;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/">Batman</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Nostalgia seeps through even the most unlikely places, in magazines and familiar illustrations from children&#8217;s magazines of the old. I have reread almost all the stories from my school english texts, and every time, I get transported to when I was an impressionable young teen. Perhaps, I still am.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is an <a href="http://kalaghodaassociation.com/">awesome arts festival</a> afoot in Mumbai - Kala Ghoda Festival and <a href="http://caferati.blogspot.com/2006/02/caferati-at-kala-ghoda.html">Caferati is hosting an evening of it</a>. The depressing part is I will leave Mumbai on the same day, just before the event starts :(</p>

<p>Here are the details:</p>

<p>Date: 12th February 2006
Venue: David Sasson Library Garden, Kalaghoda
Time: 5.30 p.m. onwards</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/2006/01/rang-de-basanti-watch-out-spoilers.html">Uma</a> said, the first half of the movie rawks. It shows all signs of greatness in the first half and would have achieved it had it not veered towards unnecessary violence in the second half. The story of the three revolutionaries was touching and real. I was not at all moved by the Bhagat Singh duplicates that flooded the market a few years back and this movie is the only one that bowled me over. Somehow, it all seems so real and relevant. But, violence never attains what it sets out to achieve is a reality that the film does not cover even though it could have.</p>

<p>Swades didnt strike a chord, not as much as Rang De Basanti, but it did show what could be done to transform the society we live in. And Rang De Basanti does that with a whimper - for two minutes after depicting violence for more than two hours. But it was enough to inspire me. The only complaint I have is against the glorification of violent acts.</p>

<p><strong>Parallel Thoughts:</strong>
What kind of history is being taught in Pakistan schools? More about Muslim League and less about Congress ( the reverse being the case in India!)?</p>

<p>Irony of it all: That the grandson of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ali_Jinnah">Father of Pakistan</a> has to be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusli_Wadia">Indian Parsi</a>!</p>

<p>HAMAS confronts its electoral victory and the shock waves it sent across the world. Hopefully, we will see a reprise of the dismantling of the IRA. Perhaps the best solution to terrorism is to thrust power to the unsuspecting terrorists. Humanity will take care of the rest.</p>

<p>What is being done about the MiG crashes anyways? Why blame the Defence Minister when the nation has seen more Defence Ministers than governments? What is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_air_force">Air Force</a> doing?</p>
