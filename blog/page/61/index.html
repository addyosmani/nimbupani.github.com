  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had the laughter clubs, the alcoholics anonymouses and now comes the <a href="http://www.drawingpower.org.uk/">Drawing Club</a>&#8230;well rather the &#8216;Drawing Event&#8217;.  (via <a href="http://www.dannygregory.com/weblog/">EveryDay Matters</a>).</p>

<p>This will be one awesome event. I think the best part of drawing is the coloring :). Well I am not being mean to sketching, but I think color has more impact than normal sketches.. atleast bright, plesant colors are the best perk ups for tired eyes.</p>

<p>Websites like <a href="http://ned.suckahs.org/">this one</a> are wonderfully relaxing after hours of staring at DOS terminals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wonder why nobody writes about Nanyang Technological University anywhere. I mean it is quite a decent university and the only technological university in Singapore!(yeah beat that!). Well I mean everyone of us (me, ex-blogger deepak and nan) always seem to focus on ourlives and NTU hovers somewhere around the background like an wannabe extra in a bollywood film (my idioms are awful).</p>

<p>Anyways, so all ye readers,  behold the splendour of Nanyang Technological University. No wait, that link goes to the University that I will study in my next life (yeah I will make sure I do enough good to earn that previledge).  Well, here it goes, my university.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh well a long hiatus. Was it worth it? I am not sure. I wanted to post so many things.. but now my computer turns into an albatross (er.. read <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/stc/Coleridge/poems/Rime_Ancient_Mariner.html">&#8216;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#8217;</a>) every two hours, preventing my creative juices from mixing smoothly.</p>

<p>My projects are chugging along and I am loving every moment of Computer Vision and Image Processing. Of course, my admiration for economics is growing.</p>

<p>A useless post deserves a useless ending. So here it goes.. The End.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img alt="Coconut Trees" src="/blog/images/coco.jpg"></img></p>

<p>I LOVE coconuts. And Chennai has loads of coconuts. Well, doesnt that picture convince you? Not if you are from <a href="http://www.kerala.com/">God&#8217;s Own Country</a> (where there are jungles of coconut trees, I hear). But in a treeless city such as Madras, coconut trees provide the sparse shade and the necessary greenery.</p>

<p>But coconut sales seem to be dwindling nowadays. Coconut vendors are now morphing into <a href="http://www.coltrane-electronics.com/tuktuk/images/india_02%20.jpg"> auto</a> drivers and carpenters. Oh well, I just hope people do not stop drinking coconut water all together. Or perhaps we shall have the <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com">soda manufacturers</a> offering coconut water in a can!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://vyom.org">Deepak</a> has closed shop finally. It was very obviously coming. But well, I guess all in good time. All of us here are having a pretty depressing time now. No jobs, no opportunity in sight to get a job and no money (yeah thats putting it loosely- no thanks I am not dying of hunger as of now) is pushing our ability to look at the sunny side of things.</p>

<p>All depressing thoughts are flooding through my mind. The time when I watched a cancer patient almost die. His shouts, tears and fear are still very real to me. His wife putting on a brave front when he was conscious - cheerful and pretending everything was alright - relapsing into tears as soon as he drifted into sleep. They were a young successful couple. A sudden attack of cancer had destroyed their fabric of existence.</p>

<p>No, I do not have much experience with pain, which explains why I find even the situation of unemployment very depressing. I can attribute it to the sheltered existence I led till I left home for this island.</p>

<p>Oh well, thats life. So I have come to realise. No matter how hard you persevere, it is the tide of time that takes you to unkown destinations. Not what you have done, or what you have the ability to do. Alright, enough of philosophical outpurings. All that matters is:
EVERYTHING WILL PASS AWAY<br/></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah, beware you photo experts, I am going to join your land soon. And why? Coz, the whole mumbo-jumbo about aperture and exposure was just explained in my Computer Vision and Image Processing lecture today!
Oh boy, what wonders can good lecturers do to you! Today was the best &#8216;technical&#8217; lecture I have heard from a NTU lecturer.</p>

<p>So, what did he say that is making me jump with joy? Well, he put forth the expert photo speak in simple language! Okay, now I know how people can focus on a flower making the rest a distant blur. You just got to adjust the aperture! Or else you adjust the focal length. But when you reduce the aperture, less light goes into the camera lens(s)(the image isnt bright) so you need to have slow shutter speed to let in maximum amount of light.</p>

<p>This aperture-light combo works in humans too. The pupil reduces in size when you in a brightly lit area (to reduce the intensity of light entering your eye, as there is too much light!) while when you are in a dark room, your pupil size increases to absorb the maximum amount of light available (as there is too less light for you to see).</p>

<p>Ah, you see the light? Awesome stuff. Apparently for maximum sharpness, pin hole cameras are the best.. I am now <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/consumer/education/lessonPlans/pinholeCamera/pinholeCanBox.shtml">trying to build one</a>! :)</p>

<p>As this blog seems to have temporarily turned into a photoblog, I thought I might as well continue with that hallucination (funny, I never seem to get over it). So here is one of the pics from the garbage of pics that accumulate my hard disk.</p>

<p>By the way, it is the year of the Monkey. A good time to remember <a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~tsjain/poetry/monkeys">Gandhi&#8217;s monkeys</a></p>
