  <div class="entry-content"><p>I reached the island day before. But as I am now no longer a recepient of free internet and non stop entertainment of the university (now that I have established myself fimly into the house) I was quite cut off for two days without internet. and that sucks. But anyways now I have made it a point to reach the university and surf the free internet the whole day and then pack my belongings and get back.  I am hoping my housemates will shift in much before that time and we can have internet and cable connection. Till then posts will be intermittent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had met <a href="http://prayatna.typepad.com/education/">Satya</a> a week back and had a fruitful discussion about Education System in India. Comparing it to the model followed in Singapore, I could not help but think how Asian universities have a long way to go compared to the American Universities, specifically in the flexibility of taking up any course as the student wishes. My university has only recently introduced a limited form of flexibility in taking up different types of Minors. I also came to know that The Times of India runs a School for Marketing where the toppers get absorbed in the Times Group. Similarly, Kiroskar runs a management school on the same principle. As Satya said, Education in India is changing in a small way. But there are several things that must be changed to let the choose seep through to the maximum number of colleges and universities.</p>

<p>I particularly would like to complain about the non-educational and hostile atmosphere in Tamil Nadu colleges where men and women are treated as belonging to different species whose mixing would lead to a catastrophe. What really is the idea? Is co-education the cause of sexual explitation of women or the idea of separating and making each look to the other as a strange species the reason for such ills? Creating the virtual separation and preventing a healthy interaction and providing an overdose of ideas through revolting and MCP movies is precisely the reason for eve-teasing and the like. I just hope the colleges in Tamil Nadu become equal to those in Bangalore for a start. We can think about changing education later, the changes in mental outlook has to come first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading and re-reading the Grand Old Man&#8217;s twenty something books over the past two weeks, I feel justified in making exaggarated comments (just like the author himself) on the portrayal of women in his novels.  Reading Wodehouse, it feels like men are the &#8220;weaker sex&#8221; and women the bossy ones.</p>

<p>All his plots has a villain in the form of a dominating mother/sister/wife, with a weak son/brother/husband unable to pose any kind of resistance to her. Then there are the fiends who create trouble for the protagonists, but very amiable young gentlemen/women who just create trouble and also become one of the main reasons for the &#8220;they lived happily ever after&#8221; ending to the story.</p>

<p>Opps, I am digressing. The main point is women. There are atleast three kinds of women in all wodehouse stories:</p>

<ul><li>Dominating Slayer of Good Men</li>
<li> First Class Snob</li>
<li>High Spirited Heroine</li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>The last of the three is who generally becomes the partner of the Hero. There are other sidey females, but falling more or less into one of the three categories.</p>

<p>The reason why I think this is important is, Wodehouse writings, for all their exaggarations, must have reflected some parts of the World Before.  And, I am sure you all would have already found women you know who can fit into the three categories described (or just watch the tamizh serials to find tailor made examples to suit the first two categories).  And from what I can see around me, its the women who seem to have a tight hold on the men and who seem to fight over men (MIL and DIL fight).  And is there anyone who is thinking about Gender Equality?</p>

<p>P.S. Wodehouse says women can&#8217;t write without a &#8220;P.S&#8221; and though it is true in my case, I hate being stereotyped. Anyways, this is to say MIL stands for &#8220;Mother In Law&#8221; and DIL follows the same pattern.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the marked day, me and <a href="http://www.selectiveamnesia.org">ravages</a> (who very kindly gave me a lift to and from the venue, thanks a zillion chandru!) made it to the watering hole quite early. While we were waiting for others to turn up, a stern looking waiter left a note which stated there was a Rs.25 cover charge for sitting in that place without ordering! So, we ordered some stuff (me going for the  cheapest, which was coincidentally Rs. 25) when <a href="http://www.kiruba.com">Kribs</a> and <a href="http://benvsben.blogdrive.com/">Alex</a> trooped in. Kribs had this idea of putting tags so people will find it easy to identify themselves with the urls :). Me and ravages were entrusted with the responsibility of writing down the names. I had this wild idea of writing something nasty about each of them in the name tags and promptly turned over the idea to the ad man Ravages who did do a great job of it :) (you can see some of the tags in lazygeek&#8217;s snaps).</p>

<p>By five people started trooping in and a round chair conference started. <a href="http://www.mdeii.blogspot.com">Anand</a>, the film maker wannabe, was the funny bunny :) (no offence anand!), who regaled the people with funny repartees along with lazygeek. The matyrs of the event were <a href="http://www.kingsley2.com">Kingsley</a> and <a href="http://sudhon.blogspot.com">Sudhon</a>, who made it despite their respective illnesses.<a href="http://www.cyberbrahma.com/rants/"> S.K.</a>, the wise forever young man :) talked about his experiences as a webmaster for Indian Railways and those of you in India who wish to have unlimited internet access for free, please start looking at the Recruitment ads for Railways IT positions!</p>

<p>Soon, it was dusk and mosquitoes got the better of kribs and we took pity on the blog evangelist and started dispersing. This was a period for some more interaction where I met <a href="http://ravikumar.blogdrive.com">Ravikumar</a>, who had tremendous respect and admiration for Lee Kuan Yew and for Singapore in general. Dinesh has described me as a &#8220;girl who does not like PSBBians or IITans&#8221;, but please! no! I just don&#8217;t like the fact that everyone seems to find some sort of common brotherhood (or sisterhood for the feminists), under &#8220;IIT&#8221; or &#8220;PSBB&#8221; and i seem to have none :P. Lazygeek found a shorter nickname for me:&#8221;pani&#8221; :P</p>

<p>I also found out, my name is too common, and this is the second such occurence (of somebody&#8217;s girlfriend having same name as mine). The first was(is) an interesting experience, with people trying to call her (including her boyfriend) would call me and then  give embarassing excuses :)</p>

<p>I then exited from the scene and enjoyed a scenic ride across madras thanks to ravages. On the whole, a very interesting experience. I know I sound like a reporter of some of those cheap neighbourhood newspapers, but then my blog report is finished.</p>

<p><a href="http://arsenalsri.rediffblogs.com/">Sri</a> has a list of bloggers who attended the meet</a> and the pics of course are at <a href="http://www.lazygeek.net">Lazygeek</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, as I was walking to a shop to pick up a pre paid card for my mobile phone, a salesman (I am assuming that person was a salesman from the tie and the huge bag that are the adornments of an Indian Salesman) hit my nose with his hand as he was asking for a lift from a passing motocyclist. Imagine my surprise when, instead of apologising, he turns and says &#8220;it&#8217;s alright&#8221;! The nerve!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For sixteen years of my life I had been taught about Jammu AND Kashmir being the &#8220;crown&#8221; of &#8216;Bharat Mata&#8217;, for the unique shape of that state. After coming to Singapore, I am puzzled by the representation of Jammu and Kashmir in Singapore newspapers. While &#8220;Jammu&#8221; is quite visibly in India&#8217;s terrain, Kashmir is seen to be shared by China and Pakistan. I wondered and thought it was the &#8220;latest map&#8221; unlike the maps we got from &#8220;atlas&#8221; industries.But coming back home, I was surprised to see Indian magazines representing India with Kashmir firmly in India&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>Why this misrepresentation? What are we trying to achieve by showing an age old map which does not represent the current reality? It is indeed sad that India can no longer be the proud owner of the &#8220;crown&#8221;, but is it not the fault of fifty years of passive governance? why should we keep thinking of the days gone by?</p>
