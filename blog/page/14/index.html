  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.selectiveamnesia.org/2008/01/05/this-meme-is-so-last-year/">SelAm</a> has asked me to participate in a meme. It has been a while since I participated in memes, so here it goes:</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>


<p>All you have to do is select and upload one photo that you have clicked this year that is special to you. Could be anything…aesthetic, technical or personal. Also, put in a short note why it is special.</p>

<p>Here is mine:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/1392438660/" title="Lonely by nimbu, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/1392438660_ecef3adc3f.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Lonely" /></a></p>

<p>This was taken somewhere in South Canera. I loved every aspect of the trip. The landscapes were out of the world and the places so remote. It was also where I tasted my first <em>Neer Dosai</em>.</p>

<p>I love this photo&#8217;s composition (even though it was a fluke!). A lonely electric pole in the sea of greenery in the early morning mist, reminds of the beautiful place instantly.</p>

<p>By the time this post goes up, the world must have heard of this meme, so the buck stops here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seastars 2007 is a music album by <a href="http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/">Ivan Chew (ramblinglibrarian)</a> and <a href="http://lekowala.wordpress.com/">Adrian Loo</a>. It is a wonderful first album for the band and is a great collection of tunes inspired by the sea.</p>

<p>My favourite track is the Dolphins Galaxia 1.1 - basically for its variation of tunes used and being so soothing. Sea Anemone and Sea Breeze were the other two songs I couldn’t forget. The rest of the songs seemed like good &#8220;background music&#8221; to listen to while you are at work. Well, that is just my take anyway. When I listened for the first time, the laughter of the child seemed unique, but the second time it sounded slightly longer than what I thought it should be.</p>

<p>But, it is a good first album nevertheless! I would definitely listen to all the songs again !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I stumbled across <a href="http://ittybiz.com/">IttyBiz</a> blog two weeks ago. Naomi Dunford (a &#8220;word nerd&#8221;) writes in a way that is entirely unique - full of humor and completely making sense (it is <em>very hard</em> to do both!). Recently, she wrote <a href="http://ittybiz.com/marketing-school-what-the-hell-is-branding/">Marketing School: What The Hell Is Branding?</a> which sent shivers down my spine (in a good way).</p>

<blockquote><p>A brand does not convey ability. It’s not supposed to. A brand is supposed to convey consistency.</p></blockquote>


<p>Struggling for the past two years to state what I do, Naomi does that easily in two sentences (okay okay, three). I have always tried to make my online appearances <em>consistent</em> to what Nimbupani Designs (and me) stand as a brand.</p>

<p>So, what do I stand for as a brand? Nimbupani Designs (<a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/about.html">even the name</a>), is not a run of the mill design shop, but is a off-the-beaten-track business. I passionately support web standards, open source projects (<a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://tabbie.wikidot.com/">Tabbie</a>). I work with <a href="http://status.deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> and we convert some of my ideas into software (one of which is coming soon to your browser).</p>

<p>My illustrations reflect that sense too. So does my sense of fashion (mostly from local designers with their small boutiques in Singapore). Possibly, I am still not articulate enough to completely define my branding, but hopefully, it would become apparent soon.</p>

<p>As for the identity, I have (with the new website) is now consistent with my business card and my sense of style (note the (over) use of yellow). Thanks to Naomi, I have something else to work on for this new year. My branding.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what is your branding? What defines you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Roger Johansson has yet again written an excellent article on how <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200712/overdoing_accessibility/">accessibility techniques are misused</a>. And I just realised how pertinent that article is with regards to my note on <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/blog-entry/accessibility-in-singapore-websites.html">accessibility in singapore websites</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, <a href="http://www.splintered.co.uk/documents/presentations/psf_accessibility_08.08.2007/PSF_too-much-accessibility-08.08.2007.pdf">the PDF by Patrick H. Lauke on Too Much Accessibility</a> is a must read for anyone who is interested in <em>not</em> abusing accessibility.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/blogging-with-drupal-part-1.html">first part</a>, we learned to setup comments, categories, and the basics for blogging with Drupal. Now we install the modules that make Drupal a powerful blogging tool.</p>


<h4>Extra Modules for Blogging Nirvana</h4>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/modules</p>


<p>Drupal&#8217;s powers become manifold with its diverse modules. For blogging, these are the most important ones:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/seo_checklist">SEO Checklist</a> - This is actually a checklist of modules you need to make your blog SEO Optimized. Install all the modules that this module suggests you to (the links to the modules are provided in the checklist). Specifically the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/pathauto">pathauto module</a> which allows you to customize urls for each type of content.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> - Generate different sets of content. The most important use for this module is the ability to generate the list of popular blog entries. Of course, this module gives you an unlimited ability to arrange content in any way you would like. Read the <a href="http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/views">Views documentation</a> to understand its full power.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/image">Image</a> - Ability to upload images to your blog entries and create image galleries. <a href="http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/image">Learn about how to set up the Image module</a>
</li>
<li>    
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/commentmail">Comment Mail</a> - Sends you an email whenever anybody posts a comment on your blog. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/comment_notify">Comment Notify</a> - Allows comment writers on your blog to choose to receive follow up comments, by email, to the post they posted their comment on. They can disable receiving the comments in the link setup in the first email they receive.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/poormanscron">Poormanscron</a> - Runs Drupal&#8217;s cron operations (which are required for your search functionality to function properly, for one). 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/print">Print</a> - Adds a &#8220;Printer Friendly Version&#8221; link to your blog entries. Settings include if you want the user&#8217;s printer to be launched when it is clicked, uploading your own print <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to format how the blog entries should look like when printed, etc. Another powerful setting here is that it allows for the linked urls in your blog entry (which do not show generally) to be collated and listed at the bottom of each printed page. Click on <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/print/node/564">Printer-friendly version</a> for this entry to check out how it works. 
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://drupal.org/project/relatedlinks">Related Links</a> - Below this entry, you can see a collection of blog entries that are related to it. This is enabled by this module. You can set the Related Links manually or have it be generated automatically by matching the categories to which the entry belongs. 
</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/tagadelic">Tagadelic</a> - Displays your categories with varying font sizes according to how often they get used.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/month">Monthly Archive</a> - Displays monthly archives of blog posts. Thanks to <a href="http://www.proxiss.de/">Rainer</a> for the prodding!</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/typogrify">Typogrify</a> - Makes your text typographically refined. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/codefilter">Code Filter</a> (Optional) - If you would be posting bits of code on your blog, then this module is for you. 
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://drupal.org/project/widgeditor">Widgeditor</a> - A <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor for your blog entry. Its light and uses <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> (comes bundled with Drupal 5). You can choose to enable it for even the comment submission forms. 
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://drupal.org/project/spam">Spam</a> - While forcing comments to be previewed before getting published, pushes back most of the spammers. You might want to install this powerful spam detection and elimination module to completely eliminate spam. 
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gotcha">Gotcha</a> - This captures the spam that you could receive from your Contact Page. Requires the Spam module mentioned above.
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Alternate Ways of Posting to your Site</h4>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path_to_drupal_website >/?q=admin/settings/blogapi</p>


<p>Firefox has a popular blogging extension called <a href="http://www.scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a> (previously called Performancing). With the Drupal Blog API, you can set up Scribe Fire to post blog entries to your blog using scribe fire. The limitation being, if you have free tagging, you cant use it (rather need to select from the list available and not create a category newly) and you cant schedule your posts. Of course, you can’t use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/scheduler">Drupal Scheduler Module</a> too.</p>


<p>Click on &#8220;Manually Configure&#8221; to add your Drupal blog to Scribefire, and in the field where you enter the <strong>Server API URL</strong>, enter http://&lt; path to your drupal website >/xmlrpc.php.</p>


<p>For other editors, check out <a href="http://drupal.org/node/6269">Alternative Ways to Enter Content</a></p>


<p>If you would like to submit your blog posts by email, then check out the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mailhandler">Mailhandler</a> module.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Drupal is a Content Management System - which means blogging is just a small cog of the big wheel of Drupal. This does make Drupal harder to use for blogging (as compared to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>), but with these modules and settings Drupal can be a very good blog workhorse. In fact, it runs this blog too!</p>

<h3>Install Drupal</h3>


<p>Download and set up Drupal 5.0 while following the <a href="http://drupal.org/getting-started/5">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<h3>Change Settings</h3>


<p>Change the settings of Drupal by logging in to your administrative dashboard (http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin).</p>

<h3>Take the site offline</h3>


<p><strong>URL:</strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/settings/site-maintenance</p>


<p>When people are visiting your site, instead of being shown an incomplete and an under construction site, you can take your site offline, this means only the admin can have access to the site and the site will not be visible to anyone else. We will come back to this page once we are done with all the set ups.</p>


<h3>Site Information</h3>


<p><strong>URL:</strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/settings/site-information</p>


<p> Change the site name, slogan, mission etc. These can be made to appear on your blog based on the theme you select.
</p>


<p>Also set the <strong>default front page</strong> to &#8220;blog/1&#8221; so that your blog becomes the index page.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Administration Theme</h3>


<p><strong>URL:</strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/settings/admin</p>


<p>Change the administration theme to one of <strong>Garland</strong>. It is a robust theme that works with any kind of Drupal administrative interface. This means whenever you visit the admin section of your site, the site will be styled like this theme.</p>


<h3>Install a blog theme</h3>


<p><strong>URL:</strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/themes</p>


<p>Download a theme from <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">Drupal.org Themes page</a> and upload it to the &#8220;themes&#8221; folder of your Drupal installation. You can preview themes at the <a href="http://themegarden.org/drupal50/">Drupal Themes Garden page</a> - it is like <a href="http://csszengarden">CSS Zen Garden</a>, but for Drupal themes (and a lot more clunky!). 
</p>


<p>Once you have uploaded the theme, go to the URL mentioned above and select the theme you have uploaded and make that your default theme. Remember, your theme will not be applied to your blog unless you set it as &#8220;default&#8221; theme.</p>


<h3>Confirm Modules are Running</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/modules</p>


<p>Make sure the following modules are selected:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Blog</li>
    <li>Blog API</li>
    <li>Comment</li>
    <li>Contact</li>        
    <li>Path</li>
    <li>Menu</li>
    <li>Search</li>
    <li>Statistics</li>
    <li>Taxonomy</li>
</ul>


<p>We will come back to this page in <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/blogging-with-drupal-part-2.html">part 2</a> to install other modules, once the basic setup is done.</p>


<h3>Settings for your blog</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/content/types/blog</p>


<p>You can set in this page whether you want to enable or disable comments for your blog entries.</p>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/content/node-settings</p>


<p>Set the number of blog posts you want to be displayed and the length of excerpts for each blog post to be displayed. By default it displays 10 blog posts on the front page and an except that is 600 characters long (you can set it to &#8220;unlimited&#8221; which effectively displays the whole post).</p>


<h3>Settings for Comments</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/content/comment/settings</p>


<p>This is where you setup comments to minimize spam (or remove spam altogether for most bloggers!). In the <strong>Posting Settings</strong>, make sure &#8220;Anonymous posters must leave their contact information&#8221; is selected, &#8220;Preview Commenting&#8221; is set to &#8220;required&#8221;. You can also set where you want the comment submission form to be displayed, and how you want the comments to be displayed. </p>


<h3>Setting up Menus</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/menu</p>


<p>If you would like to put links to other sites, or your contact page, this is the place to create them. Read up on <a href="http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/menu">how to setup and administer menus</a></p>


<h3>Setting up your Contact Page</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/menu</p>


<p>First, go to http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/contact/add and add a category for your contact form. Then, click on &#8220;Settings&#8221; to set what should be shown above the form and set a threshold on how many times the same person can ping you (to prevent spam).</p>


<h3>Setup Categories</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/content/comment/settings</p>


<p></p>

<p>If you have imported your blog from elsewhere, you will already see a &#8220;vocabulary&#8221;. Otherwise, click on &#8220;Add Vocabulary&#8221;, to start creating a container for your blog categories. Even if your &#8220;vocabulary&#8221; is setup, you can look at the following screenshot, to make your categories behave like tags. If you don’t want your categories like that, just uncheck &#8220;Free tagging&#8221;, and set the hierarchy to &#8220;Single/Multiple&#8221;.</p>


<p> <img src="http://nimbupani.com/blog/files/drupal_category.gif" alt="Drupal Category Configuration" title="Drupal Category Configuration" />
</p>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/content/taxonomy</p>


<p></p>

<p>If you need to add categories, click on &#8220;add terms&#8221; next to the &#8220;vocabulary&#8221; that has been setup for your blog in the previous step. If you have set up your vocabulary as &#8220;free tagging&#8221;, then you can create these categories on the fly when you are typing your blog post.</p>


<p></p>

<p>The intention of this is to show the categories listed in the sidebar, which we will be covering in <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/blogging-with-drupal-part-2.html">part 2</a>.</p>


<h3>Setup Menus</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/menu</p>


<p></p>

<p>Apart from your usual links to posts belonging to certain categories, you would also like to have links to other pages (e.h. contact page) or other websites you like. You can set all of them up in a menu. A menu is a set of links. Once you set up a menu, you can display them as <strong>blocks</strong> (covered below)</p>


<h3>Setup Blocks</h3>


<p><strong>URL: </strong> http://&lt; path to drupal website >/?q=admin/build/block</p>


<p></p>

<p>Blocks are sets of content in the sidebars of your blog. An example of a block would be a menu list of websites you visit daily. You can select which blocks you want displayed and choose where (left/right sidebar) here. </p>

<p>You can add blocks to your blog (e.g. you want to add your <a href="http://twitter.com/badges/html">twitter widget</a> or Feedburner chicklets). Drupal website has a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/21867">set of snippets you can use to create new blocks</a>.</p>


<p>There ends the first part, we have learned to customize the basics of a Drupal install for blogging, and in <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/blogging-with-drupal-part-2.html">part 2</a> we shall cover some kick-ass Drupal modules that make blogging with Drupal a breeze. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>    &lt;p&gt;I often get asked about how I "handle" freelancing by wannabe freelancers. These are some of the basic steps any wannabe freelancer should take care of, before you jump into freelancing.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;h3&gt;Get a Domain Name and a Hosting Solution&lt;/h3&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;You need a memorable and recognizable domain name (&lt;a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/biz/how-to-name-your-company"&gt;Read on how to name your company&lt;/a&gt;) when you start your freelancing. Domain names get more quickly passed as references than name cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://marcusvorwaller.com/blog/archives/2005/08/09/how-to-find-a-great-domain-name/"&gt;several online apps&lt;/a&gt; that makes it simple for you to create a good domain name.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of your area of freelancing, you need a hosting solution so that you can upload client files for viewing, maintain your website, or simply put files up for temporary storage.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While there are quite a number of big hosting solutions out there, my experience has been best with smaller hosting solutions (I can recommend &lt;a href="http://syminet.net"&gt;Syminet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://rimuhosting.com"&gt;rimuhosting&lt;/a&gt;) which seem to provide immediate service and accommodate special requests (e.g. installing an extra database or a linux video encoder). Make sure your hosting solution gives you FTP access, SSH (optional - only if you are a freelance developer/designer), an email account and at least 5GB of space.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Sign up for Google Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will make your life so much easier as a freelancer. Go to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/a/"&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;, sign up for the free version, and follow these &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/admins/resources/setup/"&gt;steps to set up your Google Apps account&lt;/a&gt;. Use the domain name you have created above for your Google Apps. You will have the access to your business calendar, email, and even gtalk for that domain name. If your business expands you can add more email addresses for your domain and even have shared calendar items.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Get an account with Paypal&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a freelancer, you would be dealing with clients all over the world and &lt;a href="http://paypal.com"&gt;Paypal&lt;/a&gt; takes away some of the pain of organizing global payments. A new competitor on the horizon is &lt;a href="http://checkout.google.com"&gt;Google Checkout&lt;/a&gt; (but it is not available to people outside of U.S. or U.K. yet)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Paypal, you can also track history of transactions that have been completed and keep the money in Paypal till you are ready to withdraw. After you set up your Paypal account, you &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/cps/general/NewConsumerLink-outside"&gt;link up your bank account to Paypal&lt;/a&gt; to receive your withdrawals directly to your bank.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You will also get fraudulent emails masquerading as official Paypal emails and at this point you need to know how to distinguish between them. Paypal has a tutorial on &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/cps/securitycenter/general/UnderstandPhishing-outside"&gt;how to identify if the email is from Paypal or not&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Register with an online invoicing application&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't waste your time in creating invoices in MS Word, or using any word templates, use online invoicing solutions like &lt;a href="http://blinksale.com"&gt;Blinksale&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://freshbooks.com"&gt;Freshbooks&lt;/a&gt; to manage your invoices. These services keep track of the history of your invoices, which simplifies your financial planning and payment of taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Set up Your Workspace&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good workspace can mitigate some of the effects of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury"&gt;RSI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome#Prioritizing_hand_activities_and_ergonomics"&gt;Carpal Tunnel Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Use ergonomic, adjustable desks and chairs (its worth investing in an &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,,a10-c440-p8,00.html"&gt;Aeron chair&lt;/a&gt; and a big desk like &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/categories/rooms/workspace/11717/"&gt;Ikea Galant Desk&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Get a Laptop Computer and a Workstation&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A must have for any freelancer. You can go for one with just enough RAM to sustain your tools and adequate storage space to hold files from at least 3 or 4 projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designers, illustrators, and developers get a workstation with a 24" or bigger monitor (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/magazine/16guru.html?ei=5090&amp;en=c8985a80d74cefc1&amp;ex=1287115200&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1129521853-ar/Jp1qnf0XCl9MGUEiLGA"&gt;see how bigger monitors make you work faster&lt;/a&gt;) and a powerful processor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Compile your Portfolio&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spend some time in coming up with a small set (&amp;lt; 20) of diverse and impressive works. When you are ready, create a website on your domain or put them up on free online portfolio apps like &lt;a href="http://www.carbonmade.com/"&gt;Carbonmade&lt;/a&gt;. You could also use the free blogging applications like &lt;a href="http://wordpress.com"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://vox.com"&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; to post a short write up of what you are capable of and what you have done. Make sure your contact information is available on your portfolio that is easy to locate. Send a link to this page/portfolio in emails you send out for prospective clients.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Get a Blog&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you can write, spend some time setting up a blog. &lt;a href="http://problogger.net"&gt;Problogger&lt;/a&gt; has an &lt;a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/02/14/blogging-for-beginners-2/"&gt;excellent list of tips Blogging Tips for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Give Stuff Away for Free&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a freelance developer, release some of your applications under an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license"&gt;Open Source license&lt;/a&gt; and put them on your website for free download. If you are a freelance writer, use the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses"&gt;Creative Commons License&lt;/a&gt; for a few of your short stories, or premium articles and make them available for free download on your website. If you are a designer, give away wallpapers, brushes, or posters under Creative Commons License. This gives more exposure to your work while being a constant source for prospective clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publicize the work you have made available for free on forums, blogs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Use a Feed Reader&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feed readers (like &lt;a href="http://google.com/reader/"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://bloglines.com"&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt;) can be used for tracking posts, job listings, forum posts on your area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Blog posts&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Competitors and industry experts regularly write insightful articles that would add value to your freelancing. Use &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/search"&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/blogsearch"&gt;Google Blog Search&lt;/a&gt; to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="http://delicious.com"&gt;Del.icio.us account&lt;/a&gt;, and use the search feature to find out popular bookmarks about your industry. You can also subscribe to feeds (&lt;a href="http://siteblog.wikispaces.com/subscribing"&gt;see a tutorial on how to subscribe to feeds using google reader&lt;/a&gt;) from delicious for bookmarks that match your topics of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Forum posts&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Become a member of popular web forums that are in your area of freelancing and start contributing. Forums are a good source of potential collaborators and clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Track forum posts with your feed reader so that you know which are the most appropriate posts to respond to.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Get a Contract Ready&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you must prepare yourself for freelancing offers and spend time before you get them on the procedures you would have to do to finalize the deal. One of those is drafting your contract that clients and you can sign off on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kristen Fischer says it best in &lt;a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/clients/legalese-for-freelancers-creating-a-contract/"&gt;Legalese for Freelancers: Creating a Contract&lt;/a&gt;. You need a contract as a safety measure from clients who demand unreasonable refunds or who refuse to pay for the work you have done.&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;h3&gt;Off you go!&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a small set of things that you would have to do to start your career as a freelancer, but by no means complete. Read &lt;a href="http://freelanceswitch.com"&gt;Freelance Switch for tips on how to sail through freelancing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The portfolio page which has been a year in the making - is finally <a href="http://nimbupani.com">here</a>!</p>

<p>It is a static page with some ajaxy goodness (the contact section) and some <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr>s for backgrounds (I have a wild idea of replacing the background image with some of my own illustrations - justifying using the transparent PNGs). Obviously using PNGs causes IE 6 to display the PNGs with an ugly grey background - for which there is a <a href="http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/">fix</a> - but the fix has limitations. Hence, currently, none of the links are clickable on IE 6 :( But I am still breaking my head about it.</p>

<p>The next step is to upgrade my<a href="http://www.movabletype.org"> MovableType</a> and then apply the design to that too.</p>
