  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tabish Khair, an Indian scholar based in Denmark, hits the nail on its head when he talks about the <a href="http://www.hindu.com/mag/2003/12/21/stories/2003122100410100.htm">colour of the passports</a>.  He puts very eloquently, how the new devices meant to check the travel of terrrorists are in reality just measures to check the poor races from reaching out to the &#8216;developed&#8217; world:</p>

<p><i>So, I hang on to my passport for I do not want to forget both these relationships. My passport reminds me how marginal I am in the global heart of whiteness, and how childish and superfluous are the squabbles of our (Third World) governments. My passport reminds me of what I share with Nepalis, Algerians, Nigerians, yes, even Pakistanis. My passport reminds me that bin Laden and his ilk are little more than excuses. The new rule for transit visas has little to do with terrorism and everything to do with terror of people with the wrong colour of passport. Europe and the U.S. ? and their satellites like Australia ? have long been frightened of those who have little cash and cannot be conveniently ignored. This fear goes back a long way: it did not grow out of the foolhardy act of a handful of young men flying planes into buildings in New York and Washington. That tragic event simply provided the excuse to take legislative and other action that many have wanted to take for decades in the &#8220;West&#8221;.</i></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I guess there is no harm putting in spoilers. It was an awesome movie. There were more special effects than I had ever seen. Extremely good locations. Lovely battles. Some good war speeches. Aragorn was looking so regal.</p>

<p>BUT.. but but.. there was so much grossness that I could have puked. Especially the first scene of the worm EEEEEKS. I was shocked. Then was the scene of Gollums transformation.. EEYEW.. that was gory.</p>

<p>And well, its boring in a way that the world is neatly divided into black and white. The orcs are always black, deformed and heartless. The good are all fair, righteous and only the ring will awaken the bad qualities among them. Of course the only exception of a bad fair man was Saruaman. I was quite angry that they never gave a proper ending to his story. Perhaps the actor refused to renew his contract? :)</p>

<p>And yes, the lack of any romance, save for a kiss, between Arwen and Aragorn. Eh, what kind of love it is, which happens only in dreams? Weird! And whatever love could develop between Aragorn and Eowyn  is lost even in the movie. Many people are <a href="http://www.dm.net/~theswan/kramer2.html">having thoughts</a> on the fast marriage between Eowyn and Faramir. Bah! it was a very bad attempt to have a &#8220;happily here after&#8221; ending. And weirdly we never get to see Sauron. Only his &#8216;eye&#8217;. Well, so much for the bad parts.</p>

<p>But here is the trivia, did you know that the Treebeard and Gimli are played by the same person? Christopher Lee of Dracula fame  played Saruman?  Did you know that the director of LOTR also appears in the LOTR (TTT) as a soldier of Rohan!</p>

<p>Have you seen the actors without their beards (Aragorn, Gandalf)? They don&#8217;t look regal at all I mean I can&#8217;t imagine that they were transformed into the glorious heroes with the excellent make-up and clothes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This one completes the Indian manufacturing Industry&#8217;s boom time. BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3313229.stm">reports</a> the forays of an Indian distillery into Scotland -the land of the Scotch Whisky.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like whisky. But it is interesting to read about the reactions of the connoisseurs.  Even more interesting is the fact that the drink is manufactured in Bangalore!</p>

<p>I wonder what it is about Bangalore that it is attracting the attention of not just the IT industry but also the manufacturing gangs?</p>

<p><b>P.S.</b> I remembered the ancient Indian heady drink which was very generally called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma">Soma</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever seen that board anywhere? Correct! In front of a hindu temple of course! There is no way we hindus can justify this atrocious hypocrisy.  I had <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2003/12/07/vedanta_and_hindutva.php">pointed out earlier</a> about how Hindu philosophy, by its very nature of tolerance, can claim to be universal. But the sacred books will be of no help if our attitude remains primitive.</p>

<p>I have never seen such signs outside a mosque. Nor have I seen such signs outside churches. But, yeah I did see such a sign ( Non-Parsis are not allowed ) outside the Fire Temple in Bombay. But Parsis have never been as violent as Hindus in proclaiming their religious superiority.</p>

<p>The more I read about <a href="http://www.vhp.org/">VHP&#8217;s</a> antics and the growing influence of such extremists in the Indian political scene, the more I get frightened about the future of &#8216;secularism&#8217; in India.</p>

<p>I have had teachers who believed that Muslims should &#8216;go back to where they belong&#8217;. There was even a school where compulsory registration as a life member of VHP was mandatory for admission. I then realised how deep-rooted this malaise is. India&#8217;s path towards &#8216;Unity in Diversity&#8217; has been filled with thorns but now it seems to have come to a dead end.</p>

<p>Of course, I am not denying other religions are not to be blamed. They are equally responsible. But being in majority, a little bit of &#8216;Practice What You Preach&#8217; would do good to Hindus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I guess I know what it feels like to win a lottery ticket. Thats how I felt when I saw a mail from <a href="http://www.edwardhugh.net/">Edward</a> today morning. After a harrowing battle with Java last night, the mail was refreshing,</p>

<p>So, the result is that I will be posting entries in <a href="http://www.livinginindia.com">Living In India</a>. My first entry is <a href="http://www.livinginindia.com/archives/000033.html">already up</a>. I will be talking about Indian bloggers and Indian blogs in general. Boy, seems a lot for someone who started blogging six months ago!</p>

<p>Ah, well its a start of a new journey! Hopefully I will write something useful (more than the crap that generally ends up here).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you know who was behind the whole idea of &#8220;What is real?&#8221; in the matrix?  Do you know who wrote Minority Report, Total Recall and now, the Paycheck?  Ah, you didn&#8217;t . It was a poor man called <a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/philip.html">Philip K. Dick</a>.  He was the first person to question reality and our definitions of that state. But, his foresight was not recognised and he died a poor man. Now his stories don&#8217;t sell for less than $200 million. Bah, that&#8217;s life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.khm.de/~timot/Sentences.html">This</a> is dumb charades with pictures! I am not sure who came up with this idea, but it sure is a good way to excercise your brains. I remember, in good old days, there used to be a regular feature in Reader&#8217;s Digest called <b>Picturesque Speechless</b> or something like that which describes vividly (and very funnily) a scene or a picture (A reverse of the picture DC above). My spies tell me Reader&#8217;s Digest in India will <a href="http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k3/oct/oct14.htm">henceforth be published by</a> <a href="http://www.india-today.com/aboutus.phtml">India Today Group</a>. Not sure how different it will be. But I expect a lot more ads from Cosmo, India Today,  Music Today and Book Today and some self promotion ( just like Cosmo and India Today Magazine ).</p>
