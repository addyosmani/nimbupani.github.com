  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, me and <a href="http://mitokondrion.blogspot.com">mito</a> had valiantly registered for the Women&#8217;s Day Out Three hour Aerobic workout. Mito had already started musing on how we were even gonna survive it. I, naturally, did not consider the consequences before the deed was done.</p>

<p>Yesterday we did it! We survived a three hour aerobic hi-impact workout! WHEW!</p>

<p>I met Mito around half an hour before the event started and we collected our &#8216;numbers&#8217;, I felt odd because I have never participated in any sporting event in my life and the &#8216;numbers&#8217; are carried by atheletics and not some sloth like me! Soon we were starting to warm up on the Hi/Lo Aerobics.  Basically we get to learn 5 moves which we repeat over one hour, so that even the dullest of us can remember them.</p>

<p>I was tortured and pained to sit through a beauty pageant during the break. SICK! My GOD, if only those women could think on their feet! I guess you cant simply blame them alone as the questions were equally hideous!</p>

<p>We then went through one hour of kickboxing and one hour of hiphop! I loved kickboxing. I guess it is innate in me! (My mum can attest to the innateness of it! :)).</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. the dreaded beauty pageant continued after the marathon and   it seemed like each one of the finalist won some prize or the other. I wonder who won the prize for the &#8216;cleverest answer&#8217;.</p>

<p>I found my way home and died for two hours before making up for the lost calories with a big round of Komala&#8217;s South Indian Meal!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I am over M F Hussain&#8217;s paintings, I can concentrate on reviewing the Polish Posters that were on display at <a href="http://www.theartshouse.com.sg">The Arts House</a> Print Gallery.</p>

<p>The blurb on the flyer tells me that Polish Poster Art has been deemed a seperate stream on its own with unique characteristics. And so it proves to be. Most of the posters that were on display were made during the 80s when Poland finally had some art stuff going on.</p>

<p>The sad part of the display was that all of the posters were for exhibitions of something Asian - museum exhibits, artworks, photographs, instruments, etc but not for any plays, music CDs, or movies. This was quite depressing as it seems orient did not exert any influence in polish art or posters. But nevertheless, the posters that were on display were top class!</p>

<p>I LOVED The &#8216;Lamay Graphics&#8217; of Nepal with the artwork depicting an old man who suspiciously resembled Rabindranath Tagore. Mostly, the posters were vibrant in color (save for the &#8216;Lamay Graphics&#8217; and &#8216;Aborigine Art&#8217; which were in black and white). There were also beautiful posters on islamic exhibitions which didnt use cliched colors or formats (green, arabic, hijab wearing women) but other beautiful motifs that were eye catching and still hit home.</p>

<p>On the whole, the exhibition could have included a better variety ofposters including those that had influences of the orient but not just depicting art exhibitions, musuem exhibits on asia. But an awesome experience nonetheless!</p>

<p>The exhibition is on till Oct 15 at <a href="http://www.theartshouse.com.sg">The Arts House</a> entrance aisle (apparently called the &#8216;Print Gallery&#8217;.</p>

<p><a href="http://theartshouse.com.sg/event_details.php?id=259">Online ArtsHouse Info on Orient in Polish Posters</a></p>

<p>See some <a href="http://www.poster.com.pl/circus-posters-1.htm">Polish Circus Posters.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was not allowed to take pictures of the artworks in the Arts House, hence I have linked to the Arts House event details for Polish Posters, you can glimpse a few there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><i>
I didnt want to add my opinion to a matter I have no evidence on. But there were a few points I wanted to raise while we all get together and support Gaurav and Rashmi in their crusade.</i></p>

<p>I followed with amused interest on IIPM and <a href="http://technorati.com/search/iipm">the rising ire of the bloggers</a> and my interest reached a new high when Gaurav Sabnis resigned from IBM for standing by his freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Now I condemn wholeheartedly the response of IIPM students who have not shown any kind of etiqutte or moral ethics that any student ideally should. While I do appreciate they have full right to express themselves in whatever manner they deem appropriate, they do not have the right to slander another person.</p>

<p>This is exactly what Gaurav Sabnis did <a href="http://gauravsabnis.blogspot.com/2005/08/fraud-that-is-iipm.html">in his first IIPM pos</a>t. There was no substantiated evidence that he had to claim anything about Arindam Chaudhari. I have no clue who Arindam is or what he does, but to say that he is a fraud without any evidence is not what a responsible blogger would do.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Forgive me if I sound as if it is entirely Gaurav&#8217;s fault, it isnt but there were a few words that were used quite losely which as a popular blogger with a huge audience was sure to invite attention from the IIPM &#8216;legal cell&#8217;.</p>

<p>But the worst part was the response from the so-called IIPM students, I do not know who they are (being so anonymous) but leaving such disgusting messages about Rashmi or threatening to burn some IBM Thinkpads is a very nasty response from a university that is serving a legal notice to a blogger for doing exactly the same thing -albeit more decently and eloquently.</p>

<p>(Students being the representatives of the University, and if it is true that the Dean sent a mail saying the students are threatening to burn IBM Thinkpads, then I do hold the university responsible for not taking action against the students who act in violent disregard of morality and slandering the university&#8217;s name in that process).</p>

<p>So, the point comes to the <a href="http://gauravsabnis.blogspot.com/2005/10/update.html">resignation</a>. What I am disappointed about is that it seems to me that it sends out the message that IIPM has gained ground because of their &#8216;gundaism&#8217; and that Gaurav had no choice except that to protect his freedom of expression. Moreover, it seems to be interpreted as the bloggers being the meek helpless victims.</p>

<p>But if IBM did not ask him to remove those offending posts nor ask him to resign, I do not see any reason why he should. Instead, he might have simply stood by his claims (with evidence) and let them do what they said they would. Nobody stood to lose more than IIPM by this violent behaviour of so-called management students. Moreover, with evidence, nobody would be more embarassed than the &#8216;law enforcement officials&#8217; who sent a legal notice to Gaurav.  If truth is to speak louder than words, we need to be responsible for our words by substantiating them.</p>

<p>Also, there seems to be a curiously anonymous <a href="http://youthcurry.blogspot.com/2005/10/lies-damned-lies-and-fake-blogs.html#c112896564265242805">andy</a> who is not willing to show who he/she is but instead accuses rashmi of not being professional. I would only suggest him to first be responsible for his comments by stop being anonymous and rebutting the claims without vindictiveness or slander.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to <a href="http://www.theartshouse.com.sg/">the Arts House</a> today with the sole intention of getting to see obscure Polish Posters with Oriental twist. I mistakenly went to the second floor and to my great surprise and pleasure, ran into a gallery of <a href="http://theory.tifr.res.in/bombay/leisure/art/mf-hussain.html">M F Husain</a>&#8217;s latest works! My heart lept and cries of joy were obscuring my vision -  my dream fulfilled!</p>

<p>The beauty of art is what you dont draw. For example, appreciate the beauty of <a href="http://www.zeigermann.com/cartoonist/categories/paintingsByWolf/2005/10/04.html#a4329">this sketch of Gunter Grass</a> and what speaks loudest are the lines that you imagine and interpret to exist while you wonder at the beauty of these lines that you created out of the empty space provided by the artist.</p>

<p>Husain is on that level. He is my God of Arts next to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> and I almost was too excited to even notice the painting when I went around the gallery for the first time!</p>

<p>This collection is titled &#8216;The Lost Continent&#8217; and has consistency in colors and themes. Hussain uses shiny and rough colors creating vivid attractive effects that play with the lights of the environment.</p>

<p>And for those who wish to catch his paintings rush now to the Arts House second floor as the exhibition closes tomorrow at 8.00 p.m.!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Pleasure is the tapas of the without</blockquote>


<ul>
<li>Vashishta (quoted by Roberto Calasso in <i>Ka</i>)</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679775471/002-3440320-9140851?%5Fencoding=UTF8&n=507846&s=books&v=glance">Ka</a> is a treatise on the Indian Mythology without the cloak of the recent Indian &#8220;Morality&#8221;. Ka sheds all those we have strived hard to supress - the sexual liberation of ancient Indians.</p>

<p>In Ka, Roberto Calasso, writes how Indian mythology states Rishis were the first beings Brahma entrusted the task of procreating, causing the birth of several Gods and Demons in the process.</p>

<p>Roberto also writes how Parvati was sexually attracted by Shiva even when she was just a chip of a girl which is why she did a tapas to get him.</p>

<p>In this light, I also discovered, how Pandu was cursed with death when he penetrated any women - which makes sense. When I watched mahabharata on TV, I didnt understand why Pandu had to die when he hugged Madri  =D</p>

<p>So, now when <a href="http://thetyrone.blogspot.com/">Manu</a> (interestingly, the mythological Manu was supposed to be conceived when Brahma had sex with his daughter Satarupa) sent me an email with links to blog entries on Chennai&#8217;s morality police, I pondered at what lengths we have gone to hide the sexual freedom of the old.</p>

<p>I know, a lot of you, might just be a little uncomfortable reading this entry. But that is precisely the point. To raise the shroud of hundreds of years on sexuality.</p>

<p>Now what has this got to do with the Anna University fiasco or the recent incidents of Chennai&#8217;s Moral Police rearing its ugly head? Exactly this: the basic premise of the Indian culture that expressing sexuality is wrong and reprehensible - Dina Malar embarassed women who were kissing men in a party, Anna University screams at men who wear &#8216;red and black&#8217;, Panimalar college (one of the JPR ones) uprooted trees to stop couples from sitting together under the trees, punished a male student for being friendly (in conservative standards) with a female teacher.</p>

<p>What Anna University did was not any more hypocritical than what we are used to - only it was more explicit. It is consistent with our hypocritical assumptions about women who drink, who smooch, wear or not wear clothes, Anna University imposes these rules albeit more conservative.</p>

<p>So guys, the revolution doesnt start from Anna University, but from our own perceptions. Start using the banned four letter words (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck">fuck</a> for one), use the biological names for penis and vagina, dont call sex as &#8220;that thing&#8221;. Stop thinking of women as creatures from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor">Mordor</a> and treat them as equal partners - in smoking, drinking and sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>I know many of you are already there, but there are thousands of us (including women) who arent. And with them lies the future of Indian youth.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oops, almost forgot to mention this awesome new site. <a href="http://www.publicgyan.com/">PublicGyan</a> is your source for what the masses think about what is happening in the world and what is going to happen in the world - and how that is reflected in the future events that actually happen.</p>

<p>PublicGyan is like trading - you trade &#8216;predictions&#8217; and buy or sell predictions at a price you want. If a prediction has a greater probability of becoming true, most likely it will sell at a higher price. Or, you can work like a sewer rat, sifting through the dumb ones to find a shining prediction that you think will come true!</p>

<p>Of course, the only aspect that is different from trading is, we close the predictions after they come true, or after they are no longer relevant - which only makes the game more exciting!</p>
