  <div class="entry-content"><p>Steve Jobs<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/the-passion-of-steve-jobs/?ex=1358226000&amp;en=dc35254b0fcd5490&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss" title="The Passion of Steve Jobs - Bits Blog - NYTimes.com"> ate his hat</a> when he announced the iBook application for the tablet, but the iBook portends a bright future for web designers too. Wait, what? Books and web designers, how are they even related? One word: EPUB.</p>




<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" title="EPUB - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">EPUB</a> is a publishing standard designed for reflowable content which means the book can be viewed on devices of multiple dimensions. It does this by using XHTML/CSS for rendering the book and a set of standards on top of that to store metadata that can be extracted by E-Book readers to render a table of contents and other details. </p>


<p></p>

<p>EPUB is a collection of 3 specifications:</p>


<ul>                                
    <li>Open Publication Structure (OPS) 2.0, defines what formats are allowed to be used for the content (e.g. XHTML 1.1 and CSS 2).</li>
    <li>Open Packaging Format (OPF) 2.0, describes metadata, and structure of the .epub file in XML</li> 
    <li>OEBPS Container Format (OCF) 1., specifies the directory structure of the EPUB ZIP archive.</li>
</ul>


<p>EPUB has most recently found an advocate in Apple, but is also supported by many stand-alone Book readers like <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/desktop" title="Stanza Desktop: A Revolution in Reading | Lexcycle">Stanza</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/" title="Adobe - Digital Editions">Adobe Digital Editions</a>, <a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/" title="Read ePub ebooks online : Bookworm ePub reader">Bookworm</a>, <a href="http://ebookstore.sony.com/reader/">Sony Reader</a>, and <a href="http://www.epubbooks.com/ebook-readers" title="epubBooks Digital eBook Readers. Read your epub books on an iPhone, Sony Reader, iPod Touch, Blackberry and many other eReaders | Unleash Your Books">more</a>. </p>




<p>Officially, Kindle does not support EPUB, but <a href="http://blog.fsck.com/2009/04/savory.html" title="Savory - Massively Parallel Procrastination">Savory</a> is an application you can download to Kindle, which converts EPUB to Kindle format on the fly.</p>




<h3>What is in it for you, Web Designer?</h3>


<ul>
    <li>Authors are attempting to self-publish e-books, and <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/national/2010/02/05/kindle-conniptions-how-i-published-my-first-e-book/?single_page=true" title="Kindle Conniptions: How I Published My First E-Book | Xconomy">realise they need HTML expertise to do so</a>. With your superior HTML knowledge you would have a great opportunity to win authors as clients.</li>      
    <li>Kindle sales are one of the driving factors of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/telecom/business/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222600622" title="Amazon Kindle Sales Push Profits Up 71% -- Amazon -- InformationWeek">Amazon&#8217;s 71% increase in profit since the last financial year</a>.</li>
    <li>Most e-books today are created by automated tools which are, at best, tag soup generators with no concern for design. My guess is publishers who consistently output great e-book designs would do much better in the marketplace. </li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<h3>How do I get started?</h3>


<ul>
    <li>Both Kindle and EPUB formats are based on HTML. Unfortunately, there are not many online resources for creating a Kindle book, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1440488886?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1440488886">Kindle Formatting: The Complete Guide To Formatting Books For The Amazon Kindle</a> and its <a href="http://kindleformatting.com/" title="Kindle Formatting">associated website</a> are highly recommended.</li> 
    <li>There are several resources for creating an EPUB book though. Read <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/x-dw-x-epubtut.html">this in-depth tutorial on creating an EPUB book</a> (registration required). For a light read, read this article on  the <a href="http://www.jedisaber.com/eBooks/tutorial.asp" title=".epub eBooks Tutorial">different methods of automating the creation of an EPUB book</a>.</li>
</ul>




<h3>What about HTML5 &amp; CSS3?</h3>


<p>I know it is cool to talk about HTML5 and CSS3, but you <em>cannot</em> use any of that in an EPUB book.</p>


<p></p>

<p>EPUB is an open format but no new version of the specifications have been released since 2007 (one of them is dated 2006). XHTML format has, since then, become extinct too. </p>


<p></p>

<p>There is no public roadmap, nor are the mailing list archives open to non-members (you need to pay USD1000/year to be a member). From the <a href="http://www.daisy.org/epub/project/issues/epubmaint" title="Issues for EPUB Maintenance | EPUB Maintenance">Bug Tracker</a>, it seems like there will be a new version sometime in the future.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Open Publication Structure officially requires EPUB readers to support SVG, but only <a href="http://infogridpacific.typepad.com/using_epub/2008/12/epub-svg.html">Adobe Digital Editions supports it</a>. EPUB also  supports <a href="http://blog.threepress.org/2009/09/16/how-to-embed-fonts-in-epub-files/">embedded fonts(preferably OTF) using the CSS2 definition of the @font-face rule</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Open Publication Structure does not talk about <a href="http://blog.threepress.org/2009/11/15/using-html5-video-in-epub/" title="Using HTML5 video in ePub :  Threepress Consulting blog">displaying HTML5 Videos or Flash animations</a> and most EPUB readers do not support them. </p>




<h3>Internationalization</h3>


<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Open Publication Structure &lt;a href="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops/OPS_2.0_final_spec.html#Section1.3.6" title="Open Publication Structure (OPS) 2.0 v1.0"&gt;spectacularly fails to make the case for internationalization&lt;/a&gt;, and most popular EPUB readers do not support non-western glyphs. The only way you can get around it is by embedding the font required to display international characters within the EPUB archive. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;a href="http://www.infibeam.com/Pi" title="Infibeam.com Pi - India's First eBook Reader"&gt;EPUB readers sold in India and China&lt;/a&gt; seem to have out-of-the box support for non-western fonts. &lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;You have even &lt;a href="http://www.daisy.org/epub/issues/epub-needs-support-vertical-directionality-writing" title="EPUB needs support for vertical directionality in writing | EPUB Maintenance"&gt;worse luck trying to render languages with vertical script&lt;/a&gt; (and most historical texts in Asia are written in them). &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is a way to get around it using &lt;a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/digitaleditions/2007/08/bidirectional_text_and_mathml.html" title="Digital Editions: Bidirectional text and MathML"&gt;SVG in Adobe Digital Editions&lt;/a&gt;. But, as the comments note, this is not good enough. That article was written in 2007, and there is still no sign of internationalization in Adobe Digital Editions.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>How do I keep track of this in case it becomes as cool as HTML5?</h3>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li>O&#8217;Reilly is a big EPUB supporter and has a <a href="http://labs.oreilly.com/2009/03/epub-resources-and-guides.html" title="EPUB Resources and Guides - O'Reilly Labs">great set of resources for EPUB</a> (you can follow the trail from there onwards).</li>
    <li>You might also want to read <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/02/01/uncanny-valleygirl-by-alex-de-campi-9-valentine-sales-epub-how-to-and-ipad/" title="Bleeding Cool Comic Book News and Rumors  &raquo; Uncanny Valleygirl by Alex De Campi #9: Valentine Sales, ePub How-To And iPad">this cartoonist&#8217;s take on how he created an EPUB book</a> for his <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/27/valentine-multilingual-mobile-comic.html" title="Valentine: serialized multilingual device-independent comics Boing Boing">wildly popular comic series, Valentine</a>.</li>
    <li>Here is an <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/952/epub.opml">OPML file of feeds from websites I track for EPUB news</a>. </li>
</ul>


<p>Hopefully this post will spur you to become an E-Book designer. You know where to send royalty cheques in case you become a world-famous one!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent a lot of time this month trying to get through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0472116312?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0472116312">Good Money: Birmingham Button Makers, the Royal Mint, and the Beginnings of Modern Coinage, 1775-1821</a>, but I just <em>cannot</em> read academic books. The book covers a very interesting era before the rise of paper currency when coins of small denominations were in short supply and how private corporations tried to mitigate that (rich people melted the higher denomination gold/silver to create smaller denomination coins). Unfortunately, it meanders through the years with no clear progression and is quite boring to read. It is a miracle I got through the first few chapters. Onwards with the reviews!</p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li><h3>Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865475873?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0865475873">Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things</a> is written by designer William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart talks about how complex and chemical-induced the environment around us has become. It astounded me know an average shampoo contains 22 chemicals including some used to offset the side-effects of other harmful ones.</p> 
        <p>They ask, why we have no problem using things that contain some of the most harmful chemicals which are not even allowed in the vicinity of human life in their raw form. Why does the &#8220;packaging&#8221; makes it harmless?</p> 
        <p>They also mention how &#8220;recycling&#8221; is usually misguided as it only utilizes more chemicals than normal to make these things fit for reuse.</p> 
        <p>The authors advocate the philosophy of waste = food, something that would ring true for people who still follow old cultural traditions. They suggest using things that can biodegrade   and be consumed by other living organisms. This strongly underscores for me the use of cow manure in Hindu traditions as fuel, fertilizer, and disinfectant, among others.</p>      
        <p>The book does not advocate eliminating all chemicals but judicious use of them in ways that can make the environment richer.</p>   
        <p>Everyone needs to read this book, just to understand how industries are disrupting nature.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812992180?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812992180">Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</a> is not a travel book but a book that advocates taking things slowly, travelling to gain an experience and not to tick off &#8220;must-see&#8221; places from the list. I am guilty of &ldquo;weekend&rdquo; and holiday trips done hurriedly to just see a place with a bit of &ldquo;experience&rdquo; thrown in at some three-star hotel. I would love to do this when I take a sabbatical.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>The Art of Herge, Inventor of Tintin: Volume 1: 1907-1937 (The Art of Herge)</h3>
    <p>This is a better book than <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-reviews-for-jan-2010-–-part-1.html">The Adventures of Herge</a>, with lots of pictures of Herge&#8217;s advertising, illustration works and sketches right from childhood. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0867197064?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0867197064">The Art of Herge, Inventor of Tintin: Volume 1: 1907-1937</a> seems to be written for a younger audience and contains a sanitised biography of Herge as compared to the other book.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Sagramanda: A Novel of Near-future India</h3>
        <p>This is a poor man&#8217;s version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591025958?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591025958">River of Gods</a>, and a terrible one at that. Avoid.</p>      
    </li>   
    <li>
        <h3>&ldquo;The Sandman&rdquo; by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1848563299/178-1446862-9831354">The Sandman</a> has great artwork as usual. Reading this, I realise what Neil Gaiman did with this franchise is quite radical.</p>     
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Hellboy Volume 1: Seed of Destruction</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593070942?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1593070942">Hellboy, Vol. 1: Seed of Destruction</a> is just brilliant. I now see the appeal of Hellboy (did not think much of Hellboy when I saw the movies). It is so absurd on so many levels that it is good (and I develop love-at-first-read with such stories). If you like comics and Terry Pratchett, you will love Hellboy.</p> 
    </li>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commentcloser">Comment Closer</a> to close comments on old posts to reduce spam on my blog. I wanted visitors to know immediately if a post was no longer accepting comments, and give them alternative means of contacting me about the post. You can see it in action in these two old posts: <a href="http://nimbupani.com/is-the-future-of-communication-twitter.html">post with comments</a>, <a href="http://nimbupani.com/my-first-entry-to-css-gallery-site.html">post with no comment</a>. Here is how I did this in Drupal 6:</p>


<ul>
    <li>
     <h3>Posts with no comment</h3>
        <p>Use the following in <code>node.tpl.php</code> file in your Drupal theme: </p> 
<pre><code>
&lt;?php if (($page != 0) &amp;&amp; isset($node-&gt;comment_count) &amp;&amp; $node-&gt;comment_count &lt; 1) { ?&gt;  
    &lt;?php if($node-&gt;comment == 0 || $node-&gt;comment == 1) { ?&gt;
    // Enter HTML content you want to render for posts
    // that are closed with no comment.
    &lt;?php else { ?&gt;
    // Enter HTML content you want to render for posts
    // that are open for new comments but have none.
    &lt;?php } 
} ?&gt; </code></pre>   
    </li> 
    <li>
        <h3>Posts with comments</h3>
        <p>In <code>comment-wrapper.tpl.php</code>, use the following: </p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?php if($node-&gt;comment == 0 || $node-&gt;comment == 1) { ?&gt;
    // Enter HTML content you want to render to inform the visitor
    // that new comments are no longer accepted.
&lt;?php } ?&gt;  </code></pre>
    </li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>We need to edit both <code>comment-wrapper.tpl.php</code> and <code>node.tpl.php</code> as <code>comment-wrapper.tpl.php</code> (despite its name) will NOT be rendered if a node has no comments. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems like the holiday season is a good time to read more books! So, here are 8 more books reviewed:</p>


<ul>
<li>
    <h3>American Born Chinese</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312384483?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312384483">American Born Chinese</a> is a book by a second-generation Chinese on how he overcomes the Chinese Stereotype, which is told within the tale of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong">Monkey King</a>. I find the &ldquo;moral&rdquo; a bit contradictory and confusing (Monkey King is told there is no place for him among the &ldquo;Gods&rdquo;.) At least it brings racism to the front without accusing or wronging another race.</p></li> 
<li><h3>The Best of Simon and Kirby</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845769317?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1845769317">The Best of Simon and Kirby</a> is a gorgeous book of full-page illustrations by Jack Kirby. Enough said.
</p></li>

<li><h3>Aya</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1894937902?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1894937902">Aya</a> is one of the rare graphic novels about Ivory Coast which does not talk about poverty or civil war but is a humourous look at the world of young people. I am definitely reading the whole series.</p></li> 

<li>
    <h3>The Girl Who Played with Fire</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307269981?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307269981">The Girl Who Played with Fire</a> is the next in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Trilogy" title="Millennium Trilogy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Millennium trilogy</a> by Steig Larsson. As usual it is dark and thrilling. I have never been taken up by a thriller like the ones written by him. It rankles me that we will see no more from Steig.</p></li>

It also explains how the occupation of a &ldquo;Designer&rdquo; came into existence and what separates design from art or engineering. Must read for anyone interested in design.</p></li>

It is also funny to see the real-life photos of different characters of Tintin (Dr. Muller, Thomson &amp; Thompson, Tintin, Sponz, Chang) and note how strikingly alike they are!</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>What are vendor-specific extensions?</h3>


<p>There are some CSS properties which are only supported by specific rendering engines, e.g. <code>-webkit-box-shadow</code>, <code>-moz-border-radius</code>, or <code>-o-transition-property</code>. The post <a href="http://nimbupani.com/css-references-for-mainstream-browsers.html" title="CSS References for Mainstream Browsers | Nimbupani Designs">CSS references for Mainstream browsers</a> has  links which list other vendor specific extensions. </p>




<p><a href="http://www.css3.info/vendor-specific-extensions-to-css3/">Some people</a> assert these properties exist for testing properties described in draft versions of a future standard, but many of these extensions exist to give special functionality available only on a specific rendering engines (e.g iphone web-apps, android web-apps, etc.) Many people, notoriously <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/you8217re_living_in_a_fantasy_world/" title="You&#8217;re living in a fantasy world | For A Beautiful Web">Andy Clarke</a>, support using vendor-specific extensions as much as possible without mentioning the caveats.</p>




<h3>When should you use vendor-specific extensions? </h3>


<ul>
    <li><p><strong>If your website is ONLY rendered on a specific browser</strong></p>
    <p>This is not surprising as there are lots of websites that are nothing more than iphone webapps, or those that sell Mac products (or those that support only IE or Opera Mini.) If your website is one of those, use vendor specific extension by all means (while being mindful of the caveat mentioned below.)</p></li>  
    <li><p><strong>If you have access to your website continuously throughout its existence</strong></p>
    <p>The disadvantage of using vendor-specific extensions is that they can be deprecated or their usage can change significantly on the whim of the vendor (I am using &#8220;whim&#8221; loosely). So, you need to be able to access the website you are using it on, continuously so that you can update it if that occurs.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>If it creates subtle enhancements in a browser without significant loss of usability/accessibility in other browsers.</strong></p>
<p>For example, <code>-border-radius</code> is a popular vendor-specific extension, and by not using it, there is not a significant loss to readers of your website. In contrast, <code>-multiple-column-width</code>, when not supported, will render your text in only one column which might hinder usability of the website on browsers that do not support that extension.</p> 
</li>                                                         
<li><p><strong>If it is being discussed to be supported in future versions of CSS.</strong></p>
<p>Use vendor-specific extensions only if the property exists in a W3C Recommendation or a Working Draft as a supported property (though not necessary if your website needs to work on only one browser). Declare it before any vendor-specific extensions so that, when it becomes a standard, your website will work seamlessly on all browsers that support it.</p></li> 
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>For graceful degradation, you can use <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/" title="Modernizr">Modernizr</a> which outputs a list of supported properties as multiple classes on the body element. You can then use these class selectors and declare vendor-specific extensions for them in your CSS file. </p>




<p>There is a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Dec/0130.html" title="Feature queries from fantasai on 2009-12-09 (www-style@w3.org from December 2009)">debate on the W3C mailing list</a> on detecting support for a property without using JavaScript detection like Modernizr. But, I think it is a long way away from being included in any W3C Working Draft.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2009 marks 10 years of radical change in my life. I am not the one for writing stories, but would like to note down different experiences that affected me the most this decade. This decade brought about change like no other.</p>


<ul><li><h3>2000-2001</h3>
<p>I was 15 when I passed the screening test for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology">IIT</a> (but did not make it through the main entrance exams), scored among top 1% of all Indian students studying CBSE syllabus, and was the President of my school&rsquo;s Students Council. In other words, I was a frog that was successful in a small well. I got an opportunity to study Computer Engineering in Singapore which threw my world upside down. I was used to wearing only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salwar_kameez">salwar kameezes</a> (with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dupatta">dupatta</a>), praying twice a day, speaking/thinking in tamizh, talking only to girls (I studied in a girls-only school), listening only to old hindi songs, and here I was among a crowd of kids who spoke in English/Hindi, wore—what I used to call, &ldquo;western outfits&rdquo;&mdash;had boyfriends/girlfriends and talked about their favourite bands. I have always been around my parents, and here I was in Singapore, with the prospect of at least the next 6 years alone. Needless to say, I was shedding tears everyday and getting comforted with ice cream. </p></li>
<li><h3>2001-2002</h3>
<p>I had reached a new low. I was shocked and disappointed when people I knew in the university refused to help me when I asked for help (though strangers did!) I was lonely, and more determined to make friends. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had discovered the internet (I did not know about its existence till I came to Singapore). I felt quite comfortable talking to people online. I then started speaking with confidence to my batch-mates in real life. I went to the gym, I started wearing clothes that blended in. <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> taught me to assemble my own computer, and I was downloading songs/software, and installing flavours of Linux (and for <a href="http://nimbupani.com/linux-and-mom.html">my mom</a>). Also, I had switched to thinking/speaking mainly in English.</p></li>
<li><h3>2002-2003</h3>
<p>I started to blog, and was spending late-nights learning Photoshop and Freehand. I worked on my Final Year Project, which was to generate <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5261/v05/Studentgrupper/Mobile%20Kartklienter/Artikler/J2ME_based_digital_map_system.pdf">a map that tracks your path through my campus on a mobile Linux system (PDF)</a> (yes, the precursor to your Android Google Maps!). An <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1376014">IEEE paper</a> came out of this project (because of my suggestion to use of XML for communication from the Map Server). Till this day, I receive spam from organizations asking me to &#8220;submit a paper&#8221;.</p> </li>
<li><h3>2003-2004</h3>
<p>I became an economics and finance geek. I wrote about the <a href="http://nimbupani.com/asian-financial-crisis-1997.html">Asian Financial Crisis</a> (very na&iuml;ve when I look at it now), and about the <a href="http://nimbupani.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-gold-standard.html">Gold Standard</a> (again na&iuml;ve), I did quite well in my business minor classes. I was very disappointed when finance companies did not hire me (I was hired by Motorola to do device driver development). I was envious of many of my batch-mates, who did not seem to show any interest in finance, but got hired anyway. On the bright side, my blog was one of those popular ones in India (I still have no idea why). </p></li>
<li><h3>2004-2005</h3>
<p>I got an opportunity to become an in-house designer and copywriter for a start-up. Meanwhile, I also completed the Landmark Forum which altered my thinking drastically. That was the beginning of me being a skeptic. I stopped practicing religion. I was more aware of the judgements I made of people, and less worried about &ldquo;what would people think&rdquo;. This was the year I deliberately practiced rational thought  and decided to chart my own path to success instead of the one that society deems acceptable. </p></li>
<li><h3>2005-2008</h3>
<p>I started freelancing. I had a great time working from home, though I never had &ldquo;holidays&rdquo;. I managed to travel a lot more than before and on the cheap. I no longer feared not having any money (I knew I could work), and started to enjoy life instead of waiting for retirement to do so. My mom started <a href="http://geethamanian.sulekha.com/blog/posts.htm">blogging</a> (pardon the intrusive advertisements).</p></li>
<li><h3>2008-2009</h3>
<p>I got married to Deepak (I don&rsquo;t believe in marriage, but life is easier legally). I moved to Seattle. I am glad I am here. I have found so many people willing to welcome a stranger with open arms (all you Seattle people on twitter!). US is annoying and mesmerising in equal measure. My parents have discovered the wonders of Youtube (and spend less time watching TV).</p></li></ul>


<p>So there is my story from the time I was 16 till now. I am sure everyone of you must have had life-altering circumstances and experiences sometime in your life (and I am definitely not alone in this), I hope this is of help to anyone who is going though similar period in life. </p>

<p>I have loved and enjoyed the absurdity and insight of Douglas Adam’s Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy since I read the series earlier this year. But <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345391802?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345391802">the covers for the books does not convey that at all</a>! Even <a href="http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/trailer-b">the movie trailer does a better job of presenting that</a> (with Stephen Fry!) So, here are my versions of each cover. Fans will know what each book cover stands for. If you don’t know, ask away in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, so ends this year! I cant believe it is more than a year since I started reviewing books monthly. In all, I have reviewed about 74 books (+7 now) since last November. Writing book reviews was one of my excuses to get back to writing, and I am glad it worked. Here are the books I read this month.</p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li><h3>Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!</h3><p>This book, by Art Spiegelman, was published before his best-seller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus">Maus</a>. What I really like about his work is that he does not try to justify his behavior but just presents it as is. This book is NSFW, but is an amazing insight into what goes inside the mind of Art. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375423958?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375423958">Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!</a> is a must-read if you like Maus and want to know about events that shaped the author before and after writing it.</p></li>
    <li>
        <h3>All art is propaganda: critical essays</h3>     
        <p><a href="http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays.htm">Many of these essays can be found online</a>. I really like how Orwell implicates political jargon as propaganda (no doubt a basis for “newspeak” in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">1984</a>). There are some opinions which remind me of the era he thrived in (references to natives in colonies), but he is a brilliant thinker and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0151013551?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0151013551">All Art Is Propaganda: Critical Essays</a> is mandatory reading for any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptic">skeptic</a>. </p>     
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Tourist</h3>
        <p>This is one of those mindless thrillers that is a must-read on any journey that involves planes. What is astonishing is that the author, a native of Eastern Europe, writes with such an “American” style. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312369727?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312369727">The Tourist</a> is a book worth reading if you are bored out of your skull.</p>
    </li>                             
    <li>
        <h3>The Del Rey Book of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Sixteen Original Works by Speculative Fiction&#8217;s Finest Voices</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345496329?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345496329">The Del Rey Book of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Sixteen Original Works by Speculative Fiction&#8217;s Finest Voices</a> is a bit of a mixed bag, I loved &ldquo;Sonny Liston Takes the Fall&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Daltharee&rdquo; the most, but I just could not go beyond the first paragraph of &ldquo;The Passion of Azazel&rdquo;.</p>
    </li>            
    <li>
        <h3>How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They&#8217;re Built</h3>
        <p>I would have been an architect today, if not for a scholarship to study Computer Engineering at NTU. In 1999, I was very inspired by the work <a href="http://www.dakshinachitra.net/scripts/experience.asp">Dakshinchitra</a> did to preserve old houses from demolition. This book tells you why older buildings are resilient unlike the new ones. This book is a scathing look at the modern architectural philosophy of creating buildings that look good but are painful to work/live in (and opting for demolition instead of repair) — every wall is a window and every apartment, a glasshouse. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140139966?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140139966">How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They&#x27;re Built</a> is a book everyone must read, at least so that architects can no longer get away with inefficient but &ldquo;wow&rdquo; designs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Boss of You: Everything A Woman Needs to Know to Start, Run, and Maintain Her Own Business</h3>
        <p>This book is not just for women, but for anyone who wants to start a small business. Do ignore their branding advice though (they ask you to think about questions like &#8220;what dress will your brand wear?&#8221; while creating a name — no idea what the authors thought when they created their brand of &ldquo;Raised Eyebrow&rdquo; for a Web Design company). It is filled with practical advice on how to go about starting your own business and do well at it. The authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580052363?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1580052363">The Boss of You: Everything A Woman Needs to Know to Start, Run, and Maintain Her Own Business</a> also run a <a href="http://www.laurenandemira.com/">blog</a> for entrepreneurs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Other</h3>
        <p>I really liked <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-review-for-may-2009.html" title="Book Reviews for May 2009 | Nimbupani Designs">Another Day of Life</a> also by Ryszard Kapuscinski. This slim book &mdash; a collection of his lectures &mdash; touches on a topic that confronts all of us these days — how to deal with people who do not look or behave like you. I was annoyed by his reference to Europeans as the only group of people curious enough to know about the rest of the world, but otherwise <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844673286?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1844673286">The Other</a> is quite an interesting read. 
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>


<p>That’s it! As usual, do write in the comments, or<a href="http://twitter.com/nimbupani"> reply to me on twitter</a>, if you have any books to recommend. Hope you all have great fun during the holidays!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been interacting with people online since 2000. In fact, that is how I learnt how to be sociable in real life (there are dozens of people who can testify to that transformation). I have always had a set of vague principles that I use to decide what I do online. Mostly, when it &#8220;doesn’t feel right&#8221; I either don’t write it or if it is too late, delete it or apologise for it. To reduce the occurrence of the last two, I have written down these principles instead of having my &#8220;intuition&#8221; guide me. </p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li>Not all of your friends/followers online is a friend in real life. They can become your friends, but by default they are not.</li>
    <li>If you appreciate someone online, say so and support their ventures if you find them useful. Meet them in real life, have a conversation. Social networks are simply tools to discover people you like, and once that is done, get to know them for real.</li>
    <li>Will you show every stranger on the road, a video of your family? If not, why do it online? Do you paint your face red/blue and green in support of different protests around the world? If not, why  do that to your avatars? Do you tell random strangers staring at you on the road where you are going? If not, why do you tell <a href="http://gowalla.com/">your followers on twitter</a> that? Behave online as you would with people offline. </li>
    <li>It is harder to lie online since you have to keep doing it on different networks and in different contexts. Besides, employers/dates/friends would catch your lie as soon as you say it.</li>
    <li>Fact-check every opinion you accept as truth. Watch <a href="http://tedxmidatlantic.com/live/#TylerCowen">this video</a>, watch it every time you feel you are getting sucked into a story. Everyone has an agenda, even you.</li>
    <li>Everything you say online is stored. Be careful of what you say and know the consequences of your words. <a href="http://threatened.globalvoicesonline.org/">People have been executed for blogging</a>.</li>
    <li>Do not insult people online just because it is easy to do so and even if they have insulted you.</li>
    <li>Do not talk about work unless you are authorised to do so (or you are self-employed), not even on your &#8220;anonymous blog&#8221;. Do not talk about your relationship with someone unless you have their permission (including husbands/wives/boyfriends/girlfriends/kids).</li>
    <li>
<p>Write as you would talk to a person. Do not write like this:</p>     
<blockquote>
    <p>Synthesizing interactive, content, sales, and marketing ideas into strategies that activate. Blending creative and analytical, fun and serious within a contextual approach focused on driving margin.</p>
</blockquote>
    </li> 
    <li>
    <p>It is okay to promote yourself or your services online, but don’t disrupt other people while doing so (@ replying &#8220;influential&#8221; people to make them retweet your posts, sending Direct Messages to &#8220;friends&#8221; about the latest post on your blog). Do not say stuff like this (yes, I actually found it on a bio):</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A natural leader, I’m an outstanding wingman. A natural at crafting and delivering the pitch, I inspire colleagues and clients with passion, perspective, and creative vision.</p>
    </blockquote>

<p>What are your principles? If you have not articulated them yet, it is time to do so. If not for guiding your online activities, it is at least a fun exercise in discovering what your personal filter is!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I <a href="/blog/web-design.html">write</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nimbuin">tweet</a> about HTML5 Koolaid, it is only appropriate that my website also incorporates the new and improved semantic elements of HTML5. I also figured it would be the right time to upgrade to Drupal 6. </p>


<p></p>

<p>Here is how you can create a theme which uses some of the new elements of HTML5. This is not the <em>only</em> way to do it, but simply my attempt at creating one. Please comment if you know of better ways to do it.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>


<ul><li>The new elements of HTML5 will not render correctly in Firefox 2 and below (you can see how this website renders in Firefox 2 to see the true extent of devastation). Your best bet is to output a class to body element — use that to style the page — if Firefox 2 makes a request, <a href="http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/" title="Browser.php &#8211; Detecting a user&#8217;s browser from PHP | Chris Schuld's Blog">using PHP Browser Detection</a> (this script will cause crazy results on all browsers, if you enable caching).</li>  
<li>You need <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/" title="HTML5 enabling script">Remy Sharp’s HTML 5 enabling script</a> so that IE can recognize new HTML5 elements and apply the CSS correctly.</li></ul>


<p></p>

<p>Before you start creating a HTML5 Drupal theme, <a href="http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/" title="Designing a blog with html5 | HTML5 Doctor">read this post on creating a blog with HTML 5 markup</a>. That should give you all information you need on the markup. Then, start with an existing Drupal 6 theme that you want to convert to HTML5.</p>


<p></p>

<p>These are the template files I modifed: </p>


<ul>
    <li><code>page.tpl.php</code> - I divided the content into <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>section</code> elements. I also used <code>nav</code> to be the container for the <code>primary links</code></li>
    <li><p><code>node.tpl.php</code> - Each node is an <code>article</code>. This is also where you can use the <code>time</code> element to mention the published date of a node: </p>
        <pre>
<code>&lt;time pubdate=&quot;pubdate&quot; datetime =&quot;&lt;?php echo format_date($created,&#x27;custom&#x27;, &#x27;Y-m-d&#x27;); ?&gt;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;?php echo format_date($created,&#x27;small&#x27;) ?&gt;
&lt;/time&gt; </code>
        </pre>              
        </li>
    <li><code>search-result.tpl.php</code> - I am not sure if this is correct, but I have marked up each search result as an <code>article</code>. </li>
    <li><code>search-results.tpl.php</code> - If you need a <a href="http://html5doctor.com/the-section-element/">sectioning element</a> around the search results, this is where you should add it.</li>
    <li><code>comment.tpl.php</code> - I used <code>article</code> to markup each comment. I also used <code>time</code> to render the publication date of a comment:
<pre><code>&lt;time pubdate=&quot;pubdate&quot; datetime =&quot;&lt;?php 
 echo format_date($comment-&gt;timestamp, &#x27;custom&#x27;, &#x27;Y-m-d\TH:i:s&#x27;); 
 $tzone = variable_get(&#x27;date_default_timezone&#x27;); 
 printf(&#x27;%s%02d:%02d&#x27;, ($tzone &lt; 0 ? &#x27;-&#x27; : &#x27;+&#x27;), abs($tzone / 3600), abs($tzone % 3600) / 60);
?&gt;&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php echo format_date($comment-&gt;timestamp, &#x27;small&#x27;)?&gt;
&lt;/time&gt;</code></pre>  
</li>
    <li><code>comment-wrapper.tpl.php</code> - In my theme, all comments are contained within a <code>section</code> which can be specified in this file.</li>
    <li><code>box.tpl.php</code> - I used <code>article</code> as a container for the comment form. This template renders the container for that form.</li>
    <li>Own Module — I had to create a module to use <code>article</code> to wrap the Advanced Search Form. Here is the code I used in the module:
    <pre><code>//nimbupani is the name of the module       
function nimbupani_form_alter(&amp;$form, $form_state, $form_id) {   
  if($form_id == &#x27;search_form&#x27;) {
    $form[&#x27;advanced&#x27;][&#x27;#prefix&#x27;]=&quot;&lt;article&gt;&quot;;
    $form[&#x27;advanced&#x27;][&#x27;#suffix&#x27;]=&quot;&lt;/article&gt;&quot;;      
  }  
}</code>
    </pre>  
    </li>   
</ul>




<p>The api.drupal.org has a <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/search/6/.tpl.php" title="Search for .tpl.php | Drupal API">full list of all themable template files available to you in Drupal 6</a> if your theme requires more customization. </p>


<p>You can use <a href="http://html5.validator.nu/" title="Validator.nu (X)HTML5 Validator">validator.nu</a> to test your pages. But be warned, the validator is known to lag behind the specification. So, you might get false negatives, if so, ignore them if you know you are confirming to the latest specification.</p>




<h3>Further Work</h3>


<p>This is just scratching the surface, you can also make all form elements to use HTML5 attributes, and also add <a href="http://www.marcozehe.de/2009/10/31/easy-aria-tip-4-landmarks/">ARIA landmarks</a>. These are my focus areas for the next update to my theme.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, if there is any element that is incorrectly used on this site, or if you have any suggestions on how to make the site better, do comment!</p>
