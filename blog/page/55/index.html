  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just realised what a lucky escape I have had in leaving just hours before the <a href="http://app.stb.com.sg/asp/new/new03a.asp?id=883">Indian zoo</a>landed up on my island. Sweeping away the crushes and heart throbbing of <a href="http://www.chocgirl.blogspot.com">teen kids</a> (who, btw, has used up all the synonyms of &#8220;awesome&#8221; to describe some of the items of the menagerie that gathered on the island, so haul yourself up there if you are trying to write a &#8220;thank you&#8221; note to ur boss), I feel even more thankful after watching the collection on the ever faithful Far Vision (which is, for all you Hindi nincompoops, is &#8220;Doordarshan&#8220;&#8216;s literal translation).</p>

<p>My listlessness and boredom forced my fingers to switched the damned T.V. on. And walao! I was beholding the spectacle of &#8220;Indian Oscars&#8221; on my island. The animals trooped in, with the eager &#8220;desi&#8221; crowd (who btw think every &#8220;Indian&#8221; do is a fancy dress competition they ought to win..serious!.. i even saw an aunty (un)dressed like the female protagonist in the notorious black and white mallu movies.. ask Swami for verification) cheering them and trying to reach out for God-knows-What. If only <a href="http://chocgirl.blogspot.com">Chitra</a> had told me she was also one of those, it would have been a pleasanter experience playing &#8220;where-is-chitra?&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, anyways, what I would really like to rant about is the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=iifa%20singapore&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wn">Big Deal</a> that all news channels made over it. And not just the news channels but also a &#8220;respectable&#8221; magazine like Outlook (which nowadays seem to resemble a fusion of Stardust and <a href="http://www.feminaindia.com/">Femina</a>). To hear soundbites from actors who anybody would have forgotten but the news channels and to be forced to bear the torture of hearing &#8220;what Kareena/Shilpa/nobody will be wearing for the main event?&#8221; is something that can rival the torture chambers of U.S. prisons( did u hear about <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=domesticNews&storyID=5279075">one in seventy five Americans living in prison?</a>). Now that the awful event is over, I can relax and rant about it,just like the Senior Citizen who engages in an enthralling discussion of the Triple Valve Surgery.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this aspect, I would like to compare India wtih Singapore. Singapore citizens have thrived on the services industry. Most of the citizens earned (and still do earn) their money by providing services or by being owners of small shops in big malls. or simply an owner of a small stall in an &#8220;hawker centre&#8221;. Singapore&#8217;s vigilant health and welfare ministry ensures longevity and Singapore has an alarming number of senior citizens. Moreover, the savings of the Senior Citizens, are mostly spent on the higher education of their children. After such expensive endeavours they hardly have enough to carry on with their lives without resorting to menial jobs. Though there are no official statistics, atleast three out of the five toilet cleaners in Singapore are senior citizens (from what I have seen). Apparently, the Singapore&#8217;s young think they have a choice between taking care of their parents or taking care of their children- hence neglecting the parents for the children. Finally, even if the old were relatively well off at the time of &#8220;retirement&#8221; the low interest rates in Singapore do not provide enough return on the savings. Ultimately, the old are forced to work at low wages in jobs which many would consider &#8220;demeaning&#8221; and &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; for their age.</p>

<p>The comparision is eerie. India seems to be bursting with malls remniscent of Singapore. But are we also going to bite the hands that fed us? What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s raining! YES!!! its raining in madras. Gods be blessed! Just as I was about to bang my head in frustration, I could smell the scent of the first few drops falling on the parched and over baked earth. Ah! beauty at last! feels so goood. And I would like to think of myself as the herald of rains ;) . Ooops, now that it has rained, I expect the Electrictiy Board will shut down the current for an hour to mark the solemn moment. And I better finish this off before that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whew.. finally I am back home and surfing the web on this super fast broadband internet cafe right next to my house with a sucky windows OS and Internet Explorer. Ah! How I miss my computer! :(  And amazingly this cafe does not have air-con, so I am sweltering in this heat with a woman next to me with repellent jasmine flowers( I am allergic to the scent of jasmine flowers). Of course I see more couples more open than before (atleast in internet cafes :)).</p>

<p>And I came to the city, filling my eyes with the dream of endless days lazily surfing the web and trying to improve my blog :(:(. (warning: drastic change of topic) Anybody up for a bloggers&#8217; meet?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick word to say I found a beautiful house and I will be offline for quite sometime (my comp here AND in madras are not working).. which also brings me to my trip to madras. Just when I was hoping to gain some mental peace by surfing the web as quietly as possible in madras, my mom breaks the earth rattling news of the madrasi comp&#8217;s death. I can&#8217;t understand what the problem is in the simple words she used to state it. So I gotta get back to investigate and find a solution, which will take too long a time. And I am taking too much of your time too..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought for a minute I was transported to Indiam, when I saw the <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg">Straits Times</a> headlines screaming &#8220;Gandhi moves quickly to form the Indian Govt&#8221;. Blink blink. Is this the idyllic Singapore that did not even give front page headline-screaming importance to Malaysian elections or Philipines election? Ah, apparently it was.</p>

<p>So this election has gone to show 90% of the Great Indian Middle Class does not vote. And ppl vote with their feet than with their brain.</p>

<p>Anyways, disturbingly moving to another topic, I just noticed how newspapers seem to love serif fonts while all sign boards prefer sans serif fonts.  Wonder why such preferences? I thought newspapers must be easy to read too.. not just sign boards, so why this hanging on to &#8220;tradition&#8221;?</p>

<p>On another note, my Computer is now beyond any form of salvation, with it obstinately refusing to power itself on. After three such mishaps I have given up on it for good and am relying on an efficient and fast  room mate&#8217;s computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everybody has been talking about the <a href="htp://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> relaunch and I decided to try it out and find how well made it is. And so I was trying to sign up for a blog, when I landed on a &#8220;choose your template&#8221; page. And without seeing the names of the designers I could make out who designed what. Is Web Design an implicit art form? (oops too much of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/city/.">Sex And the City</a>).</p>

<p>Anyways, as I said, I think web desginers have their own unique style that permeates through their entire portfolio. <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com">Douglas Bowman</a>, for example, uses the sharp dark blues much more than anyone else and <a href="http://www.simplebits.com">Dan Cederholm</a> manages to make eye blinding colours look good. <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com">MezzoBlue</a> uses different shades of similar colours with one stark contrasting colour (in his own website and in the blogger templates) or none at all (<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">zengarden</a>). BUt Blogger looks too good now!</p>

<p>P.S. I think the main blogger site is designed by <a href="http://www.whatdoiknow.org">Todd Dominey</a> and Douglas Bouwman.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did you know that a <a href="http://www.hugogernsback.com">Mr.Hugo Gernsback</a> was the inventor of the phrase &#8220;Science Fiction&#8221;? More importantly he was the guy who started the first geeky magazine called &#8220;Modern Electrics&#8221;. And wait, he didn&#8217;t stop at that! He predicted how technology will change the future. All this around 1930s and 40s.</p>

<p>There were others who indulged in such fantasies too (remember the clunky computers in  the year 2035 as shown in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/">Twelve Monkeys</a>?). And all these &#8220;predictions&#8221; are wonderfully organized in <a href="http://www.davidszondy.com/future/futurepast.htm">Tales of The Future Past.</a> (via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113064/">The Cartoonist</a>. Its quite interesting to revist the past and see what your ancestors thought of the future and laugh at their efforts.</p>
