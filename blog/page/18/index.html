  <div class="entry-content"><p>The silence is quite noisy I guess. So, I would rather clarify my lack of updates and also warn you that there wont be much happening till the end of June, when I intend to relaunch this site - for real. <br /><br />Meanwhile:<br /><br />I have been to Tokyo and it is a fabulous city and if you are a fashion freak you can spend your entire waking hours just gulping in the street fashion of the men and the women. And it is fairly easy to get around even if you dont know Japanese - just take the Lonely Planet with you!<br /><br />I have packed in more kilos thanks to absolutely no sense of exercise. <br /><br />I have almost forgotten how to write - shows how much blogging kept whatever writing skills I had alive!<br /><br />I have just bought an easel and a 24&#8221; LCD. Now I know why designers prefer the 24 inch. But sadly it is connected to the intel mac mini - which rules out photoshop :( <br /><br /><br /><b>So, the news is my blog is going to be dormant till the end of June, while I go under the hood and tinker with the fundamentals. <br /><br /></b></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally had an opportunity to create a Web 2.0 design for <a href="http://deepak.jois.name/gcalevent/">Deepak&#8217;s Google Calendar Event URL Generator</a> (not a <i>creative</i> name I know!).   I also used the icons from the iconset <a href="http://www.icon-king.com/v2/?p=23">Nuvola</a> released for Linux KDE.&nbsp; <br /><br />What Deepak&#8217;s page does is to generate a &#8220;remind me&#8221; button (not different from a &#8220;subscribe to bloglines&#8221; button) that, when clicked, opens in your google calendar as an event you can add. <br /><br />Here is an example of one (my birthday!):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;text=Divya%27s%20Birthday&amp;details=My%20birthday%21&amp;dates=20060718/20060718&amp;location=Singapore&amp;trp=false"><img alt="Link Button" src="http://www.google.com/calendar/images/ext/gc_button2.gif" /></a><br /><br /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the five years I have lived in Singapore, the only elections I knew where the elections to the Student&#8217;s Union of NTU. So, it was a shocking surprise when people were all worked up for the elections this year. Even more shocking was <a href="http://www.wcartc.org.sg/Meet_Mdm_Ho.html">Madam Ho</a> knocking up on my doors and wishing me!<br /><br />First, Madam Ho is very charming. Second, she has a large group of supporters/logistics people who do the groundwork of making people ready for her visit. Surprisingly, most of them spoke english haltingly (which, I think, is impossible for a Singaporean)! <br /><br />Most importantly, she climbed her way up to all the floors! If that aint hardwork I dont know what is! :) <br /><br />After a formal introduction, she asked me if I was a Singapore Citizen, and I told her I was a PR. With &#8220;Well, look at becoming a Singapore citizen soon!&#8221; she left. Perhaps, I would have heard more, if I was a citizen! <br /><br />But, really, I have no complaints, nor suggestions for improvement. My area is as best as it can be! So, I wonder, why these Meet the People sessions before the elections? Not like there are any Opposition MPs contesting this area either!<br /><br />More on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_Singapore_general_election">Singapore Elections</a>.<br /><i><br />Sidenote:</i><br />Also, I am curious to know the Singapore usage of &#8220;Madam&#8221; as a title which I havent seen elsewhere. Any idea why we use it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to watch this new Mandarin movie simply because it was produced and written by my colleague at Landmark Education - <a href="http://smellofrainmovie.com/cast-crew">Eileen Cheng</a>. But thankfully, I did! <a href="http://smellofrainmovie.com/">Smell of Rain</a> captures the emotional torment in a human being in a poetic manner but also echoes some of the conversations that we have had at some point in our life. <br /><br />The main character Xiao Qi doesnt like the smell of rain because it reminds him of the day his mother left him. And he is afraid of getting into a new relationship because of the same reason. This film captures very poetically the torments he undergoes when he is faced with the choice of declaring his love for the girl or not. The power of the film is not in the dialogues but in the long silences that puncture the lives of the characters. Silence gets new meanings and dimensions while also acting as an accessory for humour. <br /><br />What I best loved about the film were the dialogues (which I got to &#8216;see&#8217; rather than &#8216;hear&#8217; in the subtitiles). Especially, in the beginning where Xiao Qi talks about what smells he likes and how he likens the smell of rice to happiness, which is exactly what I do too! I somehow feel happy to know there are mothers and families that are having a good lunch and dinner when I smell rice.)<br /><br />Of course, one crib I have is that it could have been sharply edited. But I guess, for first time movie makers, I can excuse them for that ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>There is no certainity, only opportunity</blockquote>


<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_%28film%29"><br />V for Vendatta</a> is a remarkable film. It is a film that is hero driven from start to finish.V for Vendetta, like the Matrix, has references to several elements of philosophy, literature, history, and mythology. V is admirably played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915989/bio">Hugo Weaving</a> who I first had a crush on when I saw him first as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086672/">Bodyline Series</a>. Of course, he being ultra thin doesnt help in getting heroic roles, and in this one he has proven that he can be a hero too. <br /><br />V for Vendetta has an excellent screenplay. Every word couldnt have been more relevant or more beautifully put. V for Vendetta spouts philosophy more explicitly than the Matrix. And that, the world needs somebody who is willing to give up his life for an idea. <br /><br />I loved the dialog in the beginning of the movie about the idea. I cant recall it now, but it was something about the V being the idea and physical attributes are not necessary to know V because he is the idea (I am sure it was much better put!).<br /><br />V for Vendetta doesnt fare very well in action as compared to the Matrix or other action movies. But, the classicism of V for Vendetta is unparalleled. I loved the scene where Evey wakes up in a room choking with books and the scene where Gordon shows her his copy of the 14th century Koran. <br /><br />V for Vendetta is also mysterious. How come Gordon (Evey&#8217;s possible love interest) does and speaks exactly what V did when Evey first wakes up in the house of V? Does Evey become the next V? <br /><br />Iraq and conservative christianity is a strong undercurrent of V for Vendetta. <br /><br />Of course, <a href="http://www.shadowgalaxy.net/Vendetta/analysis.html">the comics version</a> is very different. The only thing that is common are the characters and the beginnings of V. Otherwise, they might as well have been separate entities. I saw the summary of the comics, but I prefer the movie, thank you. <br /><br />Watch it. It is worth watching just for the dialogues. <br /><br /><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thursday was the last day to redeem my $100 Starhub voucher to buy mobile phones, and just as fortunately, <a href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com">Deepak</a> lost the ugly sony ericsson he had (gathering showers of blessings in the process for losing a phone that looks fitting only in a garbage bin) and so I, generously went with him to get a phone from my $100 voucher.</p>

<p>As usual, I couldnt take my eyes off the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details/0,,128,00.html">V3 Pink</a>. And miraculously, I had enough sense to ask for the price with my current plan and the voucher. It was $98.</p>
