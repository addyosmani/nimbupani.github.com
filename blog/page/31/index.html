  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cant believe that I just attended two blog meets within a month! So, instead of writing each one separately, I thought I would combine the two and spare you of the torture!</p>

<p><strong>The Chennai Blog Meet</strong>
<a href="http://nirenjan.com">Nirenjan</a> was the sooper organizer who had made it possible to organize the meet a stone&#8217;s throw away from my house. It was at this place called Java Green that has sprung up in one of the very first &#8220;malls&#8221; in chennai (after the great spencers). There were tonnes of new faces. The <a href="http://lazygeek.net">old</a> <a href="http://kingsley2.com">one</a>s <a href="http://jsat.says.it">have</a> <a href="http://sudhon.blogspot.com">eloped</a> away from the country. There were around eleven of us. Mostly it was a quiet gathering. But it was AWESOME meeting my junior at school (which is quite infamous for not being famous and is rather a joke at most gatherings) <a href="http://thedreamydryad.blogspot.com">Sandhya</a>. I had seen her as a sprightly young thing that calls &#8220;elders&#8221; like me &#8220;Akka&#8221; in school. And there was a time when I used to do the same! Sigh&#8230;what things did we do at school!</p>

<p>Then, there were several others all from several walks of life like Maverick, Vani (who I discovered to be my junior in NTU!), Vijay, Kribs, Nilu, Balaji (the crossword geek!), Murali, Mohanty, Ravi, Shekar, Mukunth, Arun, Ravages. The talk as usual veered around geeky things like videoblogging, podcasting and crossword puzzles (courtesy Balaji!).</p>

<p>I ordered Rum Colada (or was it a Rum Cocktail?) whatever, it was supposed to be a &#8220;non-alcoholic drink&#8221;. When did rum become non-alcoholic? Then I realised there was no RUM in it at all! Argh! The drinks at Java Green were not bad at all! Though I think their typography on the menus could be better!</p>

<p><strong>The Singapore Bloggers Meet</strong>
Drumrolls for the FIRST EVER India Bloggers Meet in Singapore! Organized by the efficient Kaps. The turn out was suprisingly strong! Most of the crown were freshies (ahem..like months into blogging) while there were quite a few of us old souls like Kishore, Preetam, Nithin, Me, Onkar, Himanshu, Ashwin, Sadagopan and Mitali.</p>

<p>There was a <a href="http://ashwink.net">strong</a> <a href="http://mitali.com">South</a> <a href="http://opinion.paifamily.com">Canara</a> <a href="http://preetamrai.com">presence</a> despite the stronger tamizh presence. And the South Canarites (for want of a better word) mused on freeing themselves from the poverty of Karnataka! Hehe, was hilarious!</p>

<p>The talk moved on to politics and the difference between India and China. Sadagopan and Preetam gave very insightful stories about how China is markedly different from India. From their experiences, I could gauge that China was more passionate about being a global country with a successful economy while in India there seems to be no unity on that point.</p>

<p>There were several of my friends there from NTU =D <a href="http://onkar.blogspot.com/">Onkar</a>, <a href="http://cypherpunk.blogspot.com/">Cypherpunk</a>, <a href="http://sayesha.blogspot.com/">Sayesha</a>, <a href="http://angelsera.blogspot.com/">Angelsera</a>, and <a href="http://ultimatenigma.blogspot.com/">Ayekay</a> with a surprise arrival of DVS who lives across the road and decided to join on the spur of the moment. <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/exquisitely_moi/">Sherene</a> was the lone entrant from NUS =D.</p>

<p>We yapped away to glory till around 6 and then while everyone dispersed, Ashwin, Preetam, Kaps and me decided to try out a Burmese food stall at Peninsula Plaza (it was preetam&#8217;s idea of course!). The food was delicious -almost like indian food except everything was made with tamrind! Some of the bamboo shoots were really stinky, but some of the other vegetables were awesome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across <a href="http://lenna.org">Lena</a> when I did Image Processing and Neural Networks in NTU. A very intelligent friend of mine knew the source of the photograph and told me that it was the photograph from playboy.</p>

<p>I was hooked. I mean, when was the last time science and playboy came together? I was very curious to know the full story. Now, <a href="htp://lenna.org">Lenna.org</a> has the full story and a link to the original picture (the picture contains nudity).</p>

<p>And what&#8217;s more, she is alive and the old sexy looks are gone and in place is a glow and beauty that grows with age! Welcome back Lena!</p>

<p>P.S. There is an internet censor body in Singapore! I wasnt allowed access to one of the links in the <a href="http://lenna.org">lenna.org</a> pages. Gives me this:</p>

<blockquote> Due to Media Development Authority (MDA) regulation, this website that you are trying to access is a restricted website.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pardon me for cutting short my Mumbai Musings while I pondered on typogaffes and such. The reception conducted to the happiness of the relatives, we found our way to my relative&#8217;s house. One of those things that happens for the first time in your life.</p>

<p>The New Mumbai is the planners&#8217; paradise. If you the organized sort of person, you will love it. It is a very well planned city. But then, the old habit of living in filth hardly goes away, and so the well-planned city looks like a well planned dump.</p>

<p>Now now, Mumbaiwallas dont get incensed. What I mean to say is, you should get Onyx contract (like Chennai) for your dear city and clean it up to make it as beautiful as it was planned to be. I would rather die than walk on mumbai roads during rainy season (you never know what kind of shit is floating on water!).</p>

<p>Mumbai newspapers. If there ever was ethics, you wont know its existence in Mumbai. Newspapers scream of something all the time! Every newspaper is a tabloid. Every single one. No, they dont have tabloid dimensions, but they ALL have the same sleazy content. I surveyed <a href="http://www.asianage.com/">Asian Age</a>, <a href="http://timesofindia.com">Times of India</a>, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/">Hindustan Times</a>, and another whose name I forget now.  And they are gonna start two more! Heck!</p>

<p>I fear the same fate will befall Chennai with the invasion of the Deccan Chronicle. In the best interest of choice, we are led to the path of the hobson&#8217;s one, when every newspaper thinks the only way to  capture a market is through exclaimation marks.</p>

<p>Met cousins and <i>talked</i> to them for the first time =D. Enjoyed it! I have seen my nieces and nephew when they were one or two years old and now they are more than ten! I feel old again! Realised evolution is at work as the new generation kids are smarter than the old ones.</p>

<p>The only travelling I did was on an auto from one relative&#8217;s place to the other. Went to the subji market and actually spoke hindi for the second time in my life (attempts to speak hindi at the second language classes in school are not counted). And miraculously, the shopkeeper understood! Perhaps I should try more often =D (especially if <a href="http://ultimatenigma.blogspot.com/">AyeKay</a> can speak, why cant I? After all he is tamizh too!).</p>

<p>In the airport, saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu_Malik">Anu Malik</a> with red tight &#8220;top&#8221; (it would be demeaning to call it a &#8220;shirt&#8221;)and the trademark topi (or whatever that thing is!). Tempted to give the MTV-style &#8220;One Tight Slap&#8221;, but managed to resist the temptation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you go along with me when you travel, it is likely that you might conclude that I am either deaf or dumb. I dont talk when I am in motion. Never.</p>

<p>No it isnt like I have something against talking then. It is simply I love observing the world outside. Especially the typefaces. Now that I have enough knowledge to atleast distinguish among Helvetica, Futura, Arial and some other fonts.</p>

<p>This apparently, is now influencing my movie watching as well. I watch retro movies and am smitten by how retro the look is, and the most important element that makes it all happen is the typeface used. The typeface on shops, on tea cups, on servettes, on spoons, on badges. Each of these make a difference. And they more or less decide the retro-ness of the scene (apart from the clothes of the actors).</p>

<p>So, in this regard, Mark Simonson has a <a href="http://www.marksimonson.com/article/15/">very detailed observation on the typographic gaffes made in Titanic</a>. (I havent watched it yet!).</p>

<p>This reminds me of my deep regret at not taking a digital camera to capture all the AMAZING typefaces that were used in shops in Chennai and mumbai. The ultimate kitsch type collection =( Next time, I will not travel without a camera!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I almost forgot <a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com/2005/04/invite.html">the wedding</a> that took place and the reception I was witness to.</p>

<p>Landed in Mumbai in the late evening with a theaterical mess-up. The plane tickets say &#8220;Chatrapati Shivaji International Terminal&#8221; while the plane lands in the Domestic Airport. Before I saw the plane ticket I had informed Nandini&#8217;s family to send their driver to the Domestic Terminal. Then panic set in while looking at the plane ticket which mentions International Terminal! Woah, frantic calls to Chikku  creating pandemonium at the wedding hall =) Finally realised after the touch down that we had actually landed in the Domestic Terminal! Whew, then found the kindly driver speaking mumbaiyya hindi taking us to the wedding hall.</p>

<p>Mumbai was hot but not humid by the time I reached the wedding hall. We were in time for the reception. Finally met <a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com">Nandini </a>after more than eight months! Whew,  did she look preeeeeeety in the pink saree (there is something about pink that weaves a magic on women!). Not to mention I met <a href="http://chocgirl.blogspot.com/">CHIKKU</a> after a YEAR! Hehehhee, the kid that she always is =) But she has GROWN UP. And i feel O-L-D.</p>

<p>Met <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/chengiz/">Saurabh</a>, dunno after so many centuries! And looks like his exercise regime is working =D Looked handsome in the coat, suit and stuff.  Met the parents of both sides, looked the other way while tough questions were asked, smiled and dashed straight to the dinner buffet downstairs.</p>

<p>Ah, this is the best part -FOOOD. AWESOME VARIETY. Man, I didnt even know there were so many varities of the areca nut thingie (do I call it &#8220;supari&#8221;?). Anyways, there was so MUCH to eat!</p>

<p>Gave my dearest Nan and Saurabh an ipod shuffle. Fought away the random thought of putting it back into my bag on the sly. Nan and me were left confronting the marriage.</p>

<p>I left with the feeling of the whole &#8220;fakeness&#8221; of the wedding reception. It is like the time they give you prizes in school, only here they are receiving them. The queue to give the presents. The blinding flash light for the video recording and the even more powerful flash for the camera. I guess it is &#8220;tradition&#8221; to do that. Anyways, Nan, congratulations on what you have achieved! It is truly inspiring and amazing =D Enjoy long years of wedded bliss!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just when every Fashion Magazine That Matters (which has full sized ads of all the costliest brands on earth) started advising on how &#8220;full curls&#8221; are the summers rage, I decided to turn against the tide and go for a full rebonding.</p>

<p>And I realised there are other attractive deals that comes with the package. Two guys for instance. No, no, you naughty fella, I mean two guys to hold two hair dryers to dry your eternally straight (for six months) and flying hair that, in the expensively decorated salon and with two hair dryers, makes you look like a cheap replica of Sushmita Sen in Main Hoon Na.</p>

<p>And a lady who seems all honesty and sincerity when she fawns over my &#8220;virgin hair&#8221; - hair untouched before by any chemical. Now, my hair is no longer &#8220;virgin&#8221;. Apparently &#8220;virgin hair&#8221; has a special appeal. Just like &#8220;virgin&#8221; humans, such hair is so hard to come by.</p>

<p>The fact that the guys were also cute doesnt matter at all. Honest.</p>
