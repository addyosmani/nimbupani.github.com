  <div class="entry-content"><p>Accessibility has been in the news lately - with <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200710/update_on_the_target_accessibility_lawsuit/">Target&#8217;s accessiblity lawsuit being given the class-action status.</a> Now, lets take a look at what was missing in Target&#8217;s website that caused the complaint in the first place (summarized from the <a href="http://www.dralegal.org/downloads/cases/target/nfb_v_target_complaint.pdf">official <abbr title ="National Federation of the Blind">NFB</abbr> Vs Target legal docs</a>):</p>

<ul><li>lack of alt-text on graphics</li><li>inaccessible image maps</li><li>the lack of adequate prompting and labeling</li><li>the denial of keyboard access</li><li>the requirement that transactions be performed solely with a mouse</li><li>lack of navigational links</li></ul>




<p>In Singapore, accessibility services seems to be provided majorly by <a href="http://designafa.com/pages/clients.asp">Designafa</a> - especially for government websites. Lets see how well these are managed by their own website:</p>


<p> <dl>
<dt><em>lack of alt-text on graphics</em></dt>
<dd></p>

<p>The first thing that strikes you is that the navigation links are separated by images that have no alt text. Moreover, you have the fluffy rounded corners images with no alt text as well. The problem is not that there is no alt text, but the very existence of these images. If they are not required for screen reading why are they present - impeeding the screenreaders? They should be background images using css. Alas, as the site structure shows, they had not thought about using css and webstandards.</p>


<p></p>

<p>The next thing I notice is that the image says &#8220;Key to successful web (sic) Accessibility & Usability&#8221; while the alt text says &#8220;Accessibility for all, Making your website Accessible&#8221;. If the image does nothing but display text as an &#8220;image&#8221; then the least that should occur is that the text matches that on the image.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Another interesting alt text is this &#8220;Commemorating International Day of Disable Persons 2006&#8221; for the image that says &#8220;Forum on E-Accessibility in Singapore&#8221; and the date that is mentioned in the image is 22 June <em>2007</em>.</p>


<p></dd>
<dt><em>inaccessible image maps</em></dt></p>

<p>The site doesnt use any image maps thankfully. </p>


<p>
</dd>
<dt><em>the lack of adequate prompting and labeling</em></dt>
<dd></p>

<pre><code>This is definitely missing in the form on the &lt;a href="http://www.designafa.com/pages/contactus.asp"&gt;contact page&lt;/a&gt;. Labels are wrapped around the input elements without a "label". The fields are also filled but use javascript to erase it once clicked - I am not sure how that works well with screen readers, but I dont think it is that accessible.  
</code></pre>

<p></dd>
<dt><em>the denial of keyboard access</em></dt>
<dd>They have provided excessive keyboard access. Given that they have ordered the tab indexes as well as providing access keys for navigation links as well as other links (including blank ones for labels). The very idea of changing tab index from the natural order  itself is murky waters. The idea of access keys have got <a href="http://www.wats.ca/show.php?contentid=32">negative reactions</a> <a href="http://www.accessify.com/2005/11/trouble-with-accesskeys.php">from the accessibility community</a> (<a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/12/29/i_do_not_use/">Dave Shea&#8217;s comment</a>) (<a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/giving_the_user_control_over_accesskeys/">alternative suggestions</a>).
</dd>
<dt><em>the requirement that transactions be performed solely with a mouse</em></dt>
<dd>This again is taken care of with &#8220;onkeypress&#8221; and other inline javascripts. But for usability, the submit button is not focussed when tabbed to or even when focussed with the mouse - so u never know when the &#8220;submit&#8221; button is active or not.</dd>
<dt><em>lack of navigational links</em></dt>
<dd>This is clearly present, but their &#8220;skip to content&#8221; link goes to the content below the announcement of the latest event.</dd>
</dl></p>

<p>The idea is not to criticize their work, but to showcase what has been missed in this race to get accessibility certifications. Having an overdose of access keys or incorrect alt texts is definitely not accessible but it does not get detected in any of the automatic tests (which the website seems to clear).</p>

<p>Given that they consult the government on accessibility - I think they should have some of these things resolved. If you go to the <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/">Prime Minister&#8217;s Office website</a>, the headings are actually encapsulated in &lt;font&gt; tags - so the screen reader wont know it is a heading - which if you were able to see the website you would be able to. You might notice the unusual number of &lt;br/ &gt;s are well.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports has a &#8220;increase text size&#8221; widget slapped on the top as well. Here is what <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200709/scrap_text_resize_widgets_and_teach_people_how_to_resize_text/">Roger Johansson has to say about these text resize widgets</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Something that always bugs me is when somebody slaps a text resize widget on their site and calls it &#8220;accessible&#8221;. Job done. Maybe that is a bit unfair since there are many sites that actually are accessible that have a text resize widget, but my non-scientific guess is that a majority of sites that have a feature like that are a long way from being accessible and use a text resizing widget as a band-aid instead of addressing the underlying problem.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It is great that we have a committed organization for providing accessibility to singaporeans but the current usage of accessibility techniques in their client websites as well as their own seems like they haven&#8217;t caught up with the latest accessibility techniques as well as discarding those that are deprecated. While the websites pass the automatic tests, they still are not accessible as well as they could be to a disabled person.</p>

<p>I wanted to paint something for <a href="http://inparties.net">inparty</a> that was happening on 28th Sept, but it was too late. This was/is meant to be a study that will finally go into a canvas. Obviously, it is not meant to be symmetrical as it appears here.</p>

<p>It was the first time I was using acrylics - all thanks to <a href="http://mitokondrion.blogspot.com/">Mito</a> who had generously donated her acrylics, awesome paperworks (which you saw in <a href="http://nimbupani.com/2007/09/22/juggle.php">Juggle</a>), and other stuff that is inspiring me to paint more!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Probably going to be yet another huge void before I post again, but there were enough Indian milestones that got passed while I was in Chennai that merit mentions in this blog.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>India “celebrates” 60 years of Independence. Though ask not what is there to celebrate. There is something to celebrate though. The availability of BSNL&#8217;s cellone signal on the mobile phone when I was on top of the hills of the Someshwara Forest (and why was I there you ask? read on). I was on my way to the airport when the taxi driver quipped on the huge line of cars ahead of us that were being checked in the name of security, “Sudandhiram Ellamal Sudhandradinam Kondadrom (without independence we are celebrating our independence day)”.</p></li>
<li><p>Chennai celebrated 150 years of existence apparently. Newspapers, delighted by yet another opportunity of filling the gaps between advertisements, gladly reprinted copy written by good writers from a century ago. Also discovered that “Madras” was called “Chennai” in tamil print at least 40 years ago - which more than justifies the change.</p></li>
<li><p>I went on my first road trip and gladly I didn’t puke or fall sick. I actually <em>enjoyed</em> the 3 days. I have now seen more of Karnataka than I have seen of Tamil Nadu (my Native State). I went through reams of forests (Someshwara, Mookambika, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudremukh_National_Park">Kudremukh</a> and a bamboo forest famous for its elephants) , sea sides (<a href="http://www.holidaymakers.in/destination/beaches/murudeshwar.html">Murdeshwara</a>, <a href="http://www.karnatakatourism.com/coastal/maravante/index.htm">Marvante</a>), one backwater full of ergets, several weathers (foggy, sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, cold, hot), one historic place (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belur">Belur</a>), several religious places, lots of villages (with sheep, goats, cows, hens). Special mention must be made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agumbe">Agumbe</a> which is the most beautiful place I have seen so far!</p></li>
<li><p>The control of Chennai’s cleanliness has passed on from <a href="http://www.chennaibest.com/discoverchennai/citylifestyle/feature10.asp">Onyx</a> - resulting in Chennai going back to its nasty smelly and disgusting looking ways. For the last 6 years I was happy to note Chennai’s rising cleanliness. But apparently the people who live in Chennai never did.</p></li>
<li><p>Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam">Onam</a>. So happy Onam everyone!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So that’s that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made the mistake (in my flu induced delirium) of watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0807758/">Partner</a> an idiotic rip-off of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386588/">Hitch</a>. I would strongly recommend against watching this movie (which will take you one step closer to heaven or Oprah - whoever you believe in). The most interesting “subtle” prejudice that was seen was that the single mother in the movie was Christian (while every other character in the movie is Hindu). I think the majority thinking being Hindus cant be single mothers (which I know a lot of Hindus actually <em>believe</em>).  Of course, just like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795434/">Namastey London</a> there is a token white man who bears the brunt of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006795/">Salman Khan’s</a> lecture on the guilt of the White Colonists.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An advantage of being in the U.S. is watching movies as soon as they are released - and not waiting for eternity (or downloading a bad quality print). So, as soon as I was free, I made my way to the nearest theatre to watch my most anticipated movie of the year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29">Ratatouille</a> (yep, I am copy-pasting from google&#8217;s very helpful suggestion for my contorted spellings of the movie).</p>

<p>Of course, there is one thing that is better than the movie - and that is the short &#8220;Lifted&#8221; that plays before the movie starts. I  kinda slept through the boink-boink sheep that played before Incredibles, but &#8220;Lifted&#8221; is a whole new world. Ever know what goes on in the minds of aliens as they try to &#8220;lift&#8221; sleeping humans into their UFOs in the dead of the night? If you dont, you have to watch Lifted for a very hilarious take on it.</p>

<p>On a sidenote, Brad Bird is my new hero. I have read on several animation blogs how he took charge only 18 months before and significantly re-wrote the script <a href="http://www.gagneint.com/Final%20site/Animation/Pixar/Ratatouille_main.htm">while personally going through every animation</a>. I loved Incredibles and I am so in love with Ratatouille.</p>

<p>Back to the movie. Ratatouille obviously means a french vegetable dish, but to us french illitrates the most obvious conclusion is it has got something to do with a rat. Ratatouille (the french dish) plays a very critical role in the film, while also ending up as a name of a restaurant (in the film). We get to see Remy, the rat, develop an acute sense of culinary excellence while watching Gusteau, the celebrated french chef on TV (whose claim to fame is the book &#8220;Anyone can cook&#8221;). The most excellent scenes in the movie are when Remy tries to get his brother to understand how to sense taste and what good food means. If you have cooked for a while, you would understand exactly how that feels like.</p>

<p>Then there is Linguini, the pimply boy who is so painfully shy and so afraid of saying &#8220;no&#8221; and always screws things up. But, the character that takes the cake is Mr. Anton Ego - the harshest food critic of all France. Peter O&#8217;Toole excels in his voice over which is completely contrasting to what you know of him. Mr. Anton Ego looks talks and writes like a vulture but at the end - is a transformed man.</p>

<p>There are interesting scenes where Gusteau appears as a &#8220;figment of imagination&#8221; of Remy. And Remy asks him, &#8220;Didnt you know this?&#8221; and Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett of Robert Barone - Everybody Loves Raymond - fame) replies &#8220;I only know what you know, after all, I am only a figment of your imagination&#8221;. It is a kid&#8217;s movie and this kind of intelligence is never shown in any such movie. Perhaps, it is time for children&#8217;s movies to grow up!</p>

<p>There are hilarious moments in the movie which are not just witty dialogues but amazing physical humour. What struck me was the amazing character design that was necessary to bring all this to life. Every pose of Remy or Linguini is potent with action that voice seems almost unnecessary. It almost transported me back to the era of silent<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_jerry"> tom and jerry</a>.</p>

<p>The bottom line is: <em>Watch the movie</em>. It makes you a child again!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> wrote a very objective post on the racial profiling in <a href="http://blog.deepak.jois.name/2007/05/racial-profiling-in-singapore-rental.html">Singapore real estate rental market</a> - which I wouldn&#8217;t have been capable of - given the number of questions that owners asked about whether we were &#8220;free thinkers&#8221; and what kind of jobs we do, what kind of education we have, etc.   It was eerie to go through the process and Deepak himself experienced being cut off on the phone by some real estate agent once he told him he was Indian :)</p>

<p>Given that such events never happen otherwise in Singapore, it did seem jarring to note its increasing occurrence now in the rental market than before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we meet <a href="http://uzyn.com/about/">Chua U-Zyn</a> who is now very well known for developing <a href="http://ping.sg">Ping.sg</a>, a Singapore community portal (and blog aggregator) that everybody loves. Ping.sg has been growing in prominence ever since its launch and it is even more surprising to note that the author and the owner of the site is the freshly graduated U-Zyn! Reading the <a href="http://uzyn.com/about/">bio</a>, you might see similar patterns with the other <a href="http://websg.org/archives/2007/05/interviews_with_singapores_nex_1.php">two</a> <a href="http://websg.org/archives/2007/05/interviews_with_singapores_nex.php">web 2.0 developers</a> - the thirst to create solutions to solve a problem.</p>

<h4>1. What drives you to create applications/portals like <a href="http://lasthalo.uzyn.com/">lasthalo</a>, <a href="http://ping.sg">ping.sg</a>, <a href="http://gratisvibes.com/">gratisvibes</a>?</h4>


<p>Most of the applications that I created personally were done because of my interest, passion and by realizing the needs of certain applications. LastHalo was created because a few of my friends were using <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/">Haloscan</a> for commenting service on Blogspot blogs and they were having a hard time keeping track of latest comments. <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogspot</a> had no built-in commenting service at that time and Haloscan did not have any means of keeping track of latest comments easily then.</p>


<p><a href="http://ping.sg">Ping.sg</a> was created when I saw a need for Singapore bloggers to have an online presence that we can call home. I wanted the site to be as much community-driven as possible and not merely be a local blog listing. I started working on it without knowing that it would reach the current mass popularity.</p>


<p><a href="http://gratisvibes.com/">Gratisvibes</a> came about as a result of my passion in music. I was involved in the electronic music scene at that time and I listened to a lot of Creative-Commons-licensed electronic music albums. I realized that a lot of the CC-licensed artists and albums that don&#8217;t get much attention as they should, so I thought of creating a site to help promote free music and Creative Commons. Two of my friends are also helping me out in the site.</p>




<h4>2. How much time do you devote to <a href="http://ping.sg">ping.sg</a>?</h4>


<p>It depends. As I am a freelancer, my time is pretty flexible. When I am not that occupied with my job, I devote a lot of time to develop and maintain Ping.sg and sometimes when I am rushing to meet deadlines, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to devote even an hour per day. So far the Ping.sg community has been really helpful in helping me maintaining the site. Whenever there is an abuse or they discover a bug, someone in the community would always report to me as soon as possible.</p>


<p></p>

<h4>3. What technologies do you use on ping.sg?</h4>


<p>Ping.sg was built entirely on open source software. Ping.sg runs on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)"><abbr title="Linux Apache MySQL PHP">LAMP</abbr></a> and is built on <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, a rapid application development framework for PHP. It was among the first few applications that I built on CakePHP.</p>




<p>On top of the server-side scripting language, Javascript and AJAX of Ping.sg are largely built on <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>, a Javascript framework and <a href="http://script.aculo.us">Script.aculo.us</a> is used for some animation on the site.</p>




<h4>4. How long does it take for you to get any web app off the ground?</h4>


<p>It depends on the complexity of the application, thus it can range from 1 day to as long as a 2 months. I built the <a href="http://today.uzyn.com">RSS feed creator bot for TODAY</a> in 1 day, but took about 1 month to build Ping.sg beta. Ping.sg is still largely under development and I am still continuing to build it from time to time. Ping.sg today is totally different from what it was like during the beta stage, thus you can say that I took almost a year now to build Ping.sg.</p>




<h4>5. How many people currently use ping.sg, lasthalo, gratisvibes?</h4>


<p>Ping.sg has about 700 registered users at the time of writing with about 18K pinged entries. It is still a long road ahead to get most Singapore bloggers to be part of Ping.sg. LastHalo has about 1,000 registered users. The project is somewhat redundant now as Haloscan has finally come up with an official Latest Comments Tracker. Gratisvibes has about 110 feed subscribers at the time of writing. Since it is mainly a blog, and and it doesn&#8217;t require any registrations to read it is very hard for us to track the number of visitors to Gratisvibes.</p>




<h4>6. What is the plan for the future of ping.sg?</h4>


<p>There is still a lot of features that I am looking at adding to Ping.sg. Ping.sg is an ongoing project for me. Some of the features that I would like to add on Ping.sg are:</p>


<ol>
<li>ability to create groups for members on Ping.sg</li>
<li>Add friends and list friends for each member</li>
<li>Ranking system to encourage bloggers to blog regularly</li>
<li>Making Ping.Sg alive on the mobile phone</li>
</ol>


<p>With the extra features, hopefully Ping.sg will be able to gain the interest of many more Singapore bloggers.</p>




<h4>7. What challenges do you face in developing web apps?</h4>


<p>To me, one of the challenges in developing web apps is to create a good user-interface for each feature and functionality of an app. I noticed that sometimes developers get to engrossed in writing a good working back-end while not putting in enough effort to create a good UI that reflects the amazing features available in the back-end. I usually think from the user&#8217;s point-of-view, e.g. how would a user, with no knowledge of how an app works use it? and how he/she can use it without reading any or minimal instructions? Ironically, even web designers face the same challenge, even though they are directly responsible for designing the UI. I have seen quite a few web designers who choose aesthetics over usability of an app.</p>




<h4>8. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently with your apps, given the new technologies now?</h4>


<p>Generally I am the one who is quick to adopt to new technology. I should be among the first in Singapore to have adopted CakePHP as I see the potential in it. So as a whole, generally, I believe I am doing the best I could with the knowledge that I have during the time of my development to adhere to all the standards.</p>




<h4>9. What do you think you would be doing next? What do you see in your future as you develop for the web?</h4>


<p>I just completed my undergraduate studies and am looking forward to my work as a full time web developer. On top of my freelance work, I will also build apps that pique my interest. None of the applications I created have made me enough money to even cover my server expenses but I still built them anyway as I love making things and I will continue to do so during my free time.</p>


<p>Of course I hope that some of my personal projects will soon make some money. And hopefully enough to not just cover the server charges but also enough for me to make a living from. If that can be realized, I would be able to eventually reduce the amount of freelance work that I am doing to develop more innovative ideas of myself or of anyone&#8217;s just for the fun of it regardless of money-making opportunities.</p>




<h4>10. You have recently given your final exams for undergrad studies and there is not many students who are all about creating applications/freelancing while still studying. What drives you to do it and how did you manage it with the studies?</h4>


<p>When I was a student, I was more of a full time app developer and a part-time student rather than the other way round even though, on paper, I was a full-time student. I was a really lazy student. My friends hardly saw me in school except for labs, projects and of course exams.</p>


<p>I guess I didn&#8217;t really manage my studies well. I&#8217;m keeping my fingers crossed now, just hoping that I could pass my final exams and finally graduate.</p>




<h4>11. Ping.sg is a real hit among the singaporeans. What I noticed in the ideas section was the largest number of votes was for the idea of banning any &#8220;sex blogs&#8221;, ping.sg is based on giving each blog equal opportunity to shine and the idea of banning &#8220;sex blogs&#8221; seems to be contradicting that premise. What is your take?</h4>


<p>I have not banned any blogs that are discussing about sex, not including pornography, and as the founder of Ping.sg, I want to stick to the policy as much as possible, i.e., treat each blogger equally. Even though the &#8216;idea&#8217; is currently on top of the list of ideas in Ping.sg, the amount of votes only represent a small part of the Ping.sg users thus it cannot be assumed to be the voice of the whole Ping.sg population. Of course, this is Singapore, Ping.sg will always adhere to the local law.</p>
