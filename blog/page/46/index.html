  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think the music industry still has a lot of time as we havent yet started the broadband revolution in several countries. And even with broadband, the speed is not fast enough for the customer (not as fast as buying a cd and instantly listening to it on your CD player). Perhaps the music industry should awaken now and be aggressive in its efforts to attract the crowd of downloaders. After reading the speech, I got inspired to ponder on the alternatives the Music Industry has. Here is a list of what I think the big players should be doing:</p>

<ul><li>Have a kiosk that prints the CD covers and records a CD from a iPOD or any other storage device. Its still cool to display CDs. </li>
<li>Get new artists.</li>
<li>Get on the web and sell accessories like CD cases etc.</li>
<li>Tie up with cafes to play music on demand. Sell services. Tailor the music according to the taste of the individual customers. and play the songs available in the music companiy&#8217;s list based on the list in the iPOD. Earn income from the songs that a user downloads from the cafe server to the iPOD. Similar service through radio stations. </li>
<li>Invest in technology.Get in touch with night clubs. Provide special high quality music customised to the particular night club and unique settings. Tie up with DJs. Popularise ur records through the DJs. </li></ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have loved the web ever since I discovered blogs and bloglines. I have never been a TV addict but the web put an end to whatever little I was watching on T.V. But being online and surfing the net for sixteen hours a day, I have some complaints. These arent major but something we should start looking at, before <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a> becomes the new google.</p>

<p><strong>Domain Names:</strong> Really really pathetically organized as of now. We have some random domains &#8220;.net&#8221;, &#8220;.org&#8221;, &#8220;.com&#8221;, &#8220;.name&#8221; and countless countries. But why not have a domain name by category? Say, &#8220;.movie&#8221;? or &#8220;.tv&#8221; (&#8220;.tv&#8221; is the domain name of a tiny island which is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-1878760.html">minting millions</a> out of it)? Or &#8220;.food&#8221;? Because normally, websites are established not for specific countries but for the entire world. Web is another medium of advertisement and a quick one for a small company to showcase its potential to the whole world. In that case, if I were a small entrepreneur, I would rather get a domain name that will focus on my niche market rather than fight with the rest for the &#8220;.com&#8221; names. This will clear up the clutter in .com names and we will have websites with names that are relevant and not like the one you are currently reading :) .</p>

<p>Another advantage: if we have my dream browser, we will have a text parser that will function similar to the DOS text parser. Type &#8220;.food&#8221;, it returns a list of the top &#8220;.food&#8221; sites (using an appropriate search engine).</p>

<p><strong>Browser:</strong> Now this is one area I really really wish <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3680942.stm">gbrowser</a> will do something about. You see, when you type &#8220;nimbupani.com&#8221; it goes to nimbupani.com. But if you type x.y@gmail.com then it does not go to your email directly! Why shouldnt it? why cant a browser detect an email and directly go to the Inbox if the appropriate cookies are set? Why should I type &#8220;gmail.google.com&#8221; and then click another button over there. Agreed, it s a good torture technique but really after all these years, its time to get over it and invent a better process?</p>

<p><strong>Organizer:</strong> I know people are already doing lots of stuff on this. Basically something like a dashboard within a browser which lots of people have predicted gbrowser will have. A <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">dashboard</a> with my mail, appointments, reminders, alerts when my favourite rss feeds get updated, weather and what I am planning to eat today. We can get much more information too (updates on the latest sports scores, for instance). We just need XML and the meta data stuff and you dont ever have to move your a$$ off your seat to find out the latest information.</p>

<p><strong>Storage:</strong> In India, it takes years and years to keep waiting for a website to load. Why not use a <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/introduction.html">bittorrent</a> type of web server? Maybe use a distributed web server? I wonder why nobody has come up with a hosting solution using distributed storage systems? This is especially good for multimedia technologies. and for promoting the broadband experience. Even now, I would rather watch TV than webcasts. The initial download time is really slow even with 3Mbps connection. And I cant even dream of how long it will take in India where normal internet activity takes place with a 56kbps modem dial up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.emergic.org/archives/2004/09/23/index.html#oils_future_more_or_less">Rajesh Jain</a> quotes WSJ&#8217;s article on Mr.Doomsday of Oil, Colin Campbell:</p>

<blockquote>More to the point, nobody knows how much can be gotten out of the ground. Much of the oil lies in places with volatile politics, including the Middle East, Russia and Africa.</blockquote>


<p></p>

<p><i>Very interesting</i> So the only stable oil rich country in the middle east, except Saudi Arabia was Iraq and now she also complies with the above mentioned model for Oil Rich nations! Do I smell a sinster plot? Or is it just plain greed that drives people to invoke race/religion/colour/ethnicity to create violence?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/16/nose_driven_mouse/">Nose Operated Mouse</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine the plight of the user of such a mouse! Or the delight of the eager audience wishing to throw itself into splits of laughter over the various &#8220;positions&#8221; of the wonder nose!</p>

<p>Or even better, remember there used to be a dance where you dip your feet in colour, and create art with your stained feet, by simultaneously dancing gracefully (Our great <a href="http://www.upperstall.com/people/mgr.html">MGR</a> forgot the &#8220;grace&#8221; part when he danced his way to painting a lion, in an old B&amp;W movie)?. Now we will have the same competition for the nose! Who can twitch the nose gracefully AND be capable of drawing 3-d masterpieces on the computer within the shortest period of time!</p>

<p>Or better still I can imagine people using their noses for SMSes. Keep the mobile phone as close to your nose ans possible and move your nose in all sorts of directions and voila! you get your sms! I can imagine the shy Singaporeans warming up to this technology as they do to weekend early morning shopping at the nearest NTUC. And soon it will be fashionable for your handphones to have shrek like webcams which vie with each other for the &#8220;power&#8221; to track your nose to the nearest millimeter. So, you will have the power to configure &#8220;shortcuts&#8221; to your nose movements (something like &#8220;mouse gestures&#8221; in Moz and Opera). A small twitch of the nose will quicky send a &#8220;#@$%&#8221; reply to the most recent sms! Though I really am not sure how people with running noses, twitching every few seconds in all random directions, will manage their SMSes.</p>

<p>Ah and I was thinking of getting a new mouse! Why am I so old fashioned?</p>
