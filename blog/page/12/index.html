  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had long been fascinated with all things African. It is the only continent where you hear more about genocides than any actual development. It is quite unfair because there are actually peaceful nations in Africa and a lot of creative development goes on there because of the poor infrastructure of many nations. </p>


<p>I set about reading books/blogs on Africa to get an understanding of why/what of the current events in Africa. The book <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/books/067973869X/africa-biography-continent">Africa: A Biography of the Continent</a> is an excellent resource on the history of African nations since the origin of humans till the late 60s and 70s. I then read <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/books/0375703772/emma-war">Emma&#8217;s War</a> which is about this foolhardy Aid-worker who marries a rebel commander in Sudan. That book was a good source of on-the-ground reporting of the war in Sudan and how it came to be so.  Beware, none of these books are for the faint of the heart. The unspeakable atrocities committed by Africans on Africans is enough to depress you for a week at least! Another novel I read recently was <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/books/0385474547/fall-novel">Chinue Achebe&#8217;s Things Fall Apart</a> that talks about how the society changes after the coming of the missionaries. It has an interesting descriptions of the mythological beliefs of some tribes of Nigeria. </p>


<p>Here are some of the blogs that cover great news about Africa but most of which never gets into the main stream news:</p>


<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="http://mashilingi.blogspot.com/2008/07/e-commercem-commerce-which-way-for.html">E-Commerce solutions for Africa</a> is a blog post that talks about the opportunities of payment solutions using mobile telephony in Africa. Mobile phones have great reach in African countries as they skip the government entirely and rely on private operators. <a href="http://www.kiwanja.net/about.htm">Kiwanja</a> has a project called <a href="http://www.kiwanja.net/frontlinesms.htm">FrontlineSMS</a> which use SMS as a service to remind patients/farmers important information that can save time-consuming trips to the nearest doctors/markets.  
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.afrigadget.com">Afrigadget</a> has a <a href="http://www.afrigadget.com/2008/04/30/afrigadget-innovator-series-simon-mwacharo-of-craftskillz/">great interview with Simon Mwacharo</a> who runs CraftSkills a small business based in Nairobi that focuses on buildign self-sustainnig renewable energy projects in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Cameroon, and Rwanda. (thanks to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/thaths">Thaths</a>)</li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://afropop.org/">Afropop.org</a> has a great collection and features on evolving African music and its ties to South American/North American music. They have a great podcast too (again thanks to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/thaths">Thaths</a>). 
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://wildlifedirect.org">Wildlifedirect.org</a> is a charity that gives us the opportunity to follow the day to day activities of their partner parks/wildlife conservations (located all over the world) and to donate directly to the parks/conservations you support. For example, you could donate money to help pay the salaries of the park rangers of <a href="http://maratriangle.wildlifedirect.org/">Mara Triangle</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/darfur/">Making Sense of Darfur</a> blog seems to have interesting articles on Darfur and the recent possibility of indictment of the President of Sudan (via <a href="http://chrisblattman.blogspot.com/">Chris Blattman</a> who blogs about African news and opinions that is generally not visible in mainstream media).</li>
</ol>


<p></p>

<p>That covers most of my sources of African news. Now, if only I could find a good cheap way to get there and see all these!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been reading a lot of Science Fiction/Fantasy books lately (as you might see on <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/nimbupani/books?category=read">my list of books read</a>). The common element among most of them seem to be the idea of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">multiverse</a> - Neal Stephenson&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash</a>, Philip Pullman&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_dark_materials">His Dark Materials</a> series (Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, The Amber Spyglass), Ian McDonald&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasyl">Brasyl</a> and Neil Gaiman&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_Things">Fragile Things</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<p>While there is nothing new about Neil Gaiman&#8217;s visualization of the existence of multiple Gods and their interference in the human realm, the other books are interesting in how they define &#8220;Multiverse&#8221;. Philip Pullman&#8217;s books have parallel universes where things that are scientifically improbable in one world seems possible in an other. Lyra (the female protagonist) and Will (the male protagonist) live in the same Oxford but in different universes. </p>


<p></p>

<p>The idea exposed in Neal Stephenson&#8217;s Snow Crash is that of Virtual Reality (VR). One day the separation between the real and the virtual becomes so thin that people hook themselves up into VR as they are doing their tasks in real life. This is not a new idea, but the plot goes into how viruses in VR can cause a havoc in real life - the plot itself is very unconvincing, but the idea is essentially a great problem to think about. Is it possible that one day computer viruses can actually harm human brains?</p>


<p></p>

<p>The last of them is the Ian McDonald&#8217;s Brasyl which draws on the ideas mentioned in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality">The Fabric of Reality</a>. The book Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch states a person is a set of copies in nearby parallel worlds. From Wikipedia, &#8220;This comes out in his analysis of free will: I could have chosen otherwise is analysed as Other copies of me chose otherwise.&#8221;</p>


<p></p>

<p>What is interesting is that each copy chooses differently (since there are unknown number of copies there could be some with similar choices) and has a different life.</p>


<p>It is very exciting to think about such a multiverse. I presume religious believers will have trouble embracing multiverses into religion (though I am sure somebody is going to write in saying it is already a &#8220;fact&#8221; of Hindu philosophy).</p>


<p>I wonder what the other Divyas in the multiverses are doing right now?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read <a type="amzn" asin="0470050659">Lifehacker: 88 Tech Tricks to Turbocharge Your Day</a> which was surprisingly available in the <abbr title="National Library Board">NLB</abbr>. A lot of it is already covered in <a href="http://lifehacker.com/366859/the-best-of-lifehacker-in-upgrade-your-life">The Best of Lifehacker in Upgrade Your Life</a> (the set of sources for the second edition of the book). Here are a few things that were new and interesting:</p>


<ol><li><strong>Using Flickr to capture Business Card Details.</strong> Also tag them so that they are easy to search and make sure you keep them private.</li><li><strong>Store fitted bedsheets inside pillowcases.</strong> A great idea to save space while packing for moving (which I am doing currently!)</li><li><strong>Mirror entire websites using wget.</strong> The command is <code>wget -m http://&lt;website-address&gt;</code></li><li><strong>Using Google to look up synonyms.</strong>Use &#8220;~&#8221; next to the keyword you want to look up</li><li><strong>Useful Bookmarklets</strong> are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/feature/geek-to-live-ten-musthave-bookmarklets-129141.php">listed on Lifehacker</a></li></ol>


<p>I would definitely prefer a PDF edition as the book is worth keeping as a reference. But the Lifehacker post - The Best of Lifehacker (linked above) - already covers most of the book. </p>

My interest was piqued because it equally applies to bloggers who want to measure the success of their blog. Just realised my blog is way behind any of these metrics and it is time I created my own metrics and set up Google Analytics to measure them. Some of the <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2007/07/i-got-no-ecommerce-how-do-i-measure-success.html">advanced features of Google Analytics</a> are discussed here which help in measuring some of the metrics above.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lhmdesign has an <a href="http://mydrupalblog.lhmdesign.com/lhmdesign-redesign-write">excellent write-up</a> on how the website was redesigned with Drupal with great tips for bloggers using Drupal. A couple of tips I found extremely useful:</p>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>Listing categories in a sidebar</strong> - Create a custom block and set the input type to &ldquo;PHP Code&rdquo; and use <a href="http://tela-web.com/drupal/another-taxonomy-term-list-for-drupal/comment-page-1/#comments">this code to list categories</a>
</li>
<li><strong>Removing &quot;not verified&quot; from guest comments</strong> - Drupal puts a &quot;not verified&quot; text next to the name of the comment author if the author is not a registered user. Here is <a href="http://www.mattfarina.com/2007/04/12/removing-not-verified-anonymous-users">how to remove &ldquo;not verified&rdquo; text if you are using phpTemplate as your theme engine</a>.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just had a epiphany while reading <a href="http://tantek.pbwiki.com/CommunicationProtocols">Tantek &Ccedil;elik&rsquo;s Communication Protocols</a>. A lot of people are complaining about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/23/a-crisis-in-communication/">the inefficiency of emails</a>. What if we read emails like we read <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> statuses? What if we have e-mails incorporated as direct messages with file attachments as links?</p>


<p>The strength of twitter is the limit to 140 characters. If we force people to use twitter-like email clients (or a client that can provide a twitter interface), it will make people think twice before emailing anything - and email only what is necessary. </p>


<p>I see a great opportunity in this, at least I will use it, if it comes up in the market! :) </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was a lazy week day in 2003 when I was at the usual hangout waiting for my soul to answer the eternal question of attending a class or not, when there sprung a debate on browsers (naturally I ended up not going). While all of us geeks at the table were about to discuss good extensions for Firefox a lone dissenter <a href="http://psyphycom.blogspot.com/">Naveen</a> waxed eloquence about Opera. I decided to investigate and that was the beginning of my love affair with Opera.</p>

<p>Not everyone is blessed to meet <a href="http://psyphycom.blogspot.com/">Naveen</a>. So here are some of the must-see features of Opera that will even get Paris Hilton hooked onto it.</p>

<h3>Tabbed Browsing</h3>


<p>This is how Opera kills firefox. Open 20 tabs in Firefox and 20 in Opera and see the difference in performance (Opera is better, duh!).</p>


<h3>Speed Dial</h3>


<p>(available in version 9) Suffering from an iGoogle overdose? Here is ur minimalist replacement. Get 9 websites to show their latest home pages as soon as you open Opera. This is how I track latest deals in budget airlines websites which do not provide <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feeds</p>


<h3>Opera Mail</h3>


<p>Did you know Opera is almost the only browser that provides mail within browser (no, thunderbird is a separate app)? And it is not bad at all. It has the same set of filters and rules that you can apply to gmail. And you can use imap or pop mail servers too. It is a good way to have an offline version of your gmails. <a href="http://www.pcmech.com/article/setting-up-imap-enabled-gmail-in-opera-924/">Read more about setting up IMAP enabled Gmail in Opera</a></p>


<h3>Panels</h3>


<p>Panels are sidebars. You can load the default set of panels (History, Notes, Bookmarks, Mail, Transfers, Contacts, Links) or get web panels from <a href="http://my.opera.com/community/customize/panel/">the Opera web panels repository</a>.</p>


<h3>Links</h3>


<p>Links is a panel. It is a list of links found in a webpage. Very useful if you often find a page full of links to images you want to save, so you can just select all the links in the panel and save them all at one go. Am I the only one who does that?</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>


<p>
    Very useful if you like scribbling like me. This post started as a note there. Just remember, the first line is used to identify a note, so put in the title of your note there.
</p>


<h3>Widgets</h3>


<p>Opera 9 has <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/">widgets</a> like the mac dashboard - except it works for Windows too. You can even play <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/4196/">3-D tetris</a> if you are bored! Here are some of the widgets I like:</p>


<ul>
    <li><a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/4632/">dotoo</a> - a to-do list manager</li>

<h3>IRC</h3>


<p>If you are an <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> addict, Opera has a built-in chat client that is as good as any <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> client gets.</p>


<h3>Feed Reader</h3>


<p>Opera has a decent feed reader for a casual feed reading person (&lt; 100 feeds). When you click on any <abbr title="eXtended Markup Language">XML</abbr> feed, it will automatically ask you if it should add the feed to the Opera feed reader.</p>


<p>That’s all folks! If you liked what you have seen so far <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/">download Opera</a> and enjoy your Opera nirvana. Granted it might not actually make Paris Hilton switch from Internet Explorer, but you guys can switch from Firefox!</p>
