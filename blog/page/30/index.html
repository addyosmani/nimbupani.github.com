  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two terror attacks in differeny continents. Same message: Violence Doesnt Work.</p>

<p>I like Gandhi. He was the smartest activist around. He knew violence doesnt get results. All it gets are reasons. Violence never worked. We have two World Wars to prove that.</p>

<p>That does not mean, you do nothing about terrorism. Attack the terrorists. Find them out. Bring them to justice. Dont attack the nations. Dont use terror attacks as reasons to justify killing people.</p>

<p>Saving the world by killing millions of innocents? Is that ironical or what?</p>

<p>All fanatics who are now ready to blame islam and their lack of &#8220;culture&#8221; or &#8220;development&#8221;, please note that it takes two to tango. Instead of blaming them for their perceived lack of &#8220;development&#8221;, look at what you have done because of blaming them, you simply push them deeper and deeper into the dark ages!</p>

<p>Muslims were the first to bring Indian thought to the western world, and we should be grateful for that. And be proud of the pioneers of science, development and globalization. It hasnt reached anywhere near the peak it had before. But stop making it a voodoodoll for your irresponsibility. Each of us are responsible for the two terror attacks that occured, in the way we behave, the way we think and interact with others.</p>

<p>Dont waste two minutes in silence for the dead, do something in the two minutes to prevent others from dying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While on my jaunt to the <a href="http://sg.ksdb.com/768039.page">lunch hour hogging center</a>, I came across this spanking building that houses these two singapore biggies: <a href="http://www.aviva.com/">Aviva</a> and <a href="http://www.nkfs.org/">NKF</a>. And I also spotted the following on the building:</p>

<p>&#8230;Officially opened by:</p>

<p>MRS. GOH CHOK TONG&#8230;</p>

<p>I was flabbergasted. Here I am, in a country of equal opportunities, a &#8220;developed&#8221; country, a country that is flush with money and soon to be rich in casino cash, and they could only label the person who presided over the opening ceremony as a &#8220;Mrs. Goh Chok Tong&#8221;? Doesnt she have a name? And if they do not find her &#8220;worthy&#8221; in her own right, why invite her in the first place?</p>

<p>And it is very curious why would anyone consent to open a building that doesnt even respect the individual doing the ceremony but rather prizes her relationship with the ex-Prime Minister (as a wife). And all this in a country where &#8220;meritocracy&#8221; is prized the most.</p>

<p>And very curiously, all google results have &#8220;Mrs. Goh Chok Tong&#8221; rather than her name! And it <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&biw=1280&q=%22mrs.+lee+hsien+loong%22&btnG=Search">seems</a> to be a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&biw=1280&q=%22mrs.+lee+kuan+yew%22&btnG=Search">tradition</a> to refer to all women married to celebrities to be referred this way! How come the men who get married to celebrities do not get this &#8220;privilege&#8221;? Can we have <a href="http://www.zoetay.org/bio.htm">Mr. Zoe Tay</a> standing up please?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those from the NTU gang, would know Pa2 very well. And apparently he has caught the blogging fever too and is blogging about <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/leadingtrump/">how to get into M$</a>.</p>

<p>More scandalous stuff would follow if there are enough &#8220;bonded&#8221; scholars interested in doing what he did ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.cityofsound.com">City Of Sound</a> has often brought to my  notice, the art and culture of cities and what makes a city, a city. And in this context, I wonder if we would know Singapore as Singapore if 90% of the population were Indians or Malay?</p>

<p>This thought occured to me while walking down deserted Shenton Way (one of the arteries of Singapore), and I thought &#8220;see! even when the road is deserted, you cant say it is not singapore!&#8221;. Then another thought came to my mind, what if I see a whole lot of caucasians and african americans simply walking through the streets like they do in New York? Would Singapore remain Singapore then?</p>

<p>Singapore has been defined by the culture of immigration. The whole city was built by immigrants and therefore, diversity is not new. But, if we see a gradual decline of diversity, then Singapore would no longer remain the Singapore we know now.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the best example would be London. What did the &#8220;good old days&#8221; of London have? They had the same buildings and ruins, but they had only caucasians and an evolving culture. The culture didnt change till the immigrants came in. London is no longer what it was in her past. She had evolved and become somebody new. This, sparks nostalgia and longing for &#8220;good old days&#8221; resulting in backlashes against immigrants for &#8220;changing the face of london&#8221;.</p>

<p>I realised this. People make the cities. Cities change and evolve not because the architecture changes, but fundementally becuase there are different people there. Bangalore is another example of such a transformed city. Bangalore is a cultural melting pot of Indians and you can surely find all races and creeds of Indians there. As a result, you see the Bangalore crowd distinct from people from other parts of India. Surely, the &#8220;older generation&#8221; cant identify with this &#8220;cultural revolution&#8221; and long for the &#8220;good old days&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I had breakfast with <a href="http://deepak.jois.name/">Deepak</a> at this place called Aromas Cafe (forgot the exact name). First I have to tell you about the location before I go ga-ga over the cafe itself.</p>

<p>Craig Road is one of those streets that have been &#8220;preseved&#8221; in their colonial forms. This means, all you can see in that street are shop houses (though capitalism has taken over and destroyed several of them to build a spanking new condo). And this is no mean street mind you, there are these &#8220;massage parlours&#8221; which mysteriously are open only in the night (they appear more mysterious with the pictures of topless men and women in their banners), small art galleries, law firms, interior decorators, real estate offices, and the works.</p>

<p>Craig Road is very unique because of two shops. It has an antique shop and <a href="http://www.aromas.com.sg/boutique_cafes.htm">a cafe</a>. I consider this antique shop tops the list of the best places to window shop. I have been much of an antique worm  even before I knew the meaning of the word. I love antiques. Even papers, soap boxes, coins, chains, chairs, magazines and the works. And in Chennai, my favourite haunts were the old newspaper shops where you sell your old newspapers and get some measley coins in exchange. And this shop on Craig Road has the EXACT same feeling. Except it is populated by wooden furniture.</p>

<p>The guy who mans the shop is a sharp, witty old fella. He apparently sources antiques for others. And the interior decorators I got to know there, say he is very good at sourcing antique furniture for their designs.</p>

<p>The shop is magical. I was entranced by every item he has. The best was the broken gramophone. I havent seen one in my life and my spirits soared to see one! Anyways, it is the shop to go to if you love nostalgia and the British Raj relics.</p>

<p>The second uniqueness of Craig Road is this cafe. Its name begins with &#8220;Aroma&#8221; and I was too fascinated by the ambience to even bother knowing the full name. And yes, it was GREAT. And if the antique shop was the godown, the cafe was the palace.</p>

<p>The cafe is in colonial style, replete with the antique furniture. They werent any fake antiques but REAL ONES. This, of course, melts my heart and would have gladly parted with my life savings, if they had just asked. The best part were the fans. Sighhhhhhhhhh&#8230;why dont they make such fans these days!</p>

<p>Not to mention, the breakfast was delicious. Never before I had such heavenly scrambled eggs. Never sat in such antique, unique chairs before. Felt like a colonial enjoying a quiet British breakfast.</p>

<p>Pictures will be up once I save enough to buy a good camera for such use or pester <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/vmulky/">vrush</a> to wield her lens on such items of beauty!</p>
