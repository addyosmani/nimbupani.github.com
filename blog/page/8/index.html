  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems like I read more books than there is space to review. So, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380821214?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0380821214">Eric</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156032783?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0156032783">Fiddlers</a> (the last book written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Hunter">Ed McBain</a>) go unreviewed (in short: good reads). Here are the rest of the books I read this month:</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>What is it all about? Philosophy and Meaning of Life</h3>
        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Baggini">Julian Baggini</a> is the common man&rsquo;s philosopher who uses plain english to explain and contrast different philosophies. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195315790?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0195315790">This book</a> is about the &ldquo;Meaning of Life&rdquo;, the eternal human quest to find meaning and purpose to life — in religion, in altruism, in culture, etc. It was good to read reasoned arguments (with references!) on why religion is not the answer to that question (short answer: purpose is what you make of it). If you are interested in philosophy but can&rsquo;t be bothered to read Plato, Spinoza, Nietzsche, etc., read this book.</p>
        <p>It is not the definitive book about &ldquo;Meaning of Life&rdquo;. Do not have high hopes on attaining enlightenment after reading this book.</p>
        <p>The references section starts with &ldquo;You can also learn much which is true and wise in Douglas Adam&rsquo;s Hitch Hiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy books. For more &mdash; but not too much more &mdash; on why the traditional arguments for the existence of God fail, see&hellip;&rdquo; &mdash; can&rsquo;t agree more!</p>
    </li>                      
    <li>
        <h3>Maus: A Survivor&rsquo;s Tale</h3>
        <p>Of all the movies and books I have read and seen about the holocaust, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394747232?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0394747232">Maus</a> is undoubtedly the best. It is written in first person by the cartoonist and describes his conversations with his father (who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp) about the holocaust.</p>
        <p>The deep set prejudice of Vladek ((the author&rsquo;s father) against blacks (despite being being subjected to the same as a Jew in germany) and the author&rsquo;s own anger/insensitivity to his father are described without any excuses.</p>
        <p>The survival of Vladek is a remarkable story. It amply showcases how ingenious and resourceful he had to be to survive. If there is anything to learn from this, it is that, choosing &ldquo;Status Quo&rdquo; without reason and on hope is the worst choice you can make.</p>
    </li>                               
    <li>
        <h3>The Best of Gene Wolfe: A Definitive Retrospective of His Finest Short Fiction</h3>                   
        <p>To be honest, I was really bored with some of the stories in this list (most likely because I didn’t understand them), but, “The Death of Doctor Island&rdquo;, &ldquo;Detective of Dreams&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Toy Theatre&rdquo; were amazing! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a> is highly regarded by critics and is considered an influential science fiction writer (though not the best-selling).</p>
    </li>      
    <li>
        <h3>Create your own economy</h3>               
        <p>I was hoping to read a lot more about what it means to be the information-whore that I am &mdash; not to mention my maniacal urge to classify them. But this book spends a lot of time on what it means to be autistic, why it is not a disability and how a lot of successful people may be autistics (7 pages to explain how Sherlock Holmes might be one!). By the end of the book, you are left <em>hoping</em> that you are autistic, as you are convinced that you need to be one before you can be called a genius.</p>
        <p>I was disappointed as I expected something else. But <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/jbc/Tyler/">Tyler Cowen</a> has an entertaining writing style and is my guru for how he processes information, so all is forgiven :)</p>
     </li>                                                         
    <li>
        <h3>A Fortune-Teller Told Me: Earthbound Travels in the Far East</h3>
        <p>The author is an unapologetic colonialist. I found his views disgusting despite his vivd, entertaining writing.</p>
        <p>He berates the loss of &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace&rdquo; in South East Asia because of &ldquo;development&rdquo; — failing to mention the economic growth and improvement to healthcare such developments cause. He constantly stereotypes different races (it is appalling how he got away with that). I knew I was going to hate reading it when the word &ldquo;manageress&rdquo; cropped up every second page.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he goes on like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner">the ancient mariner</a>. You feel compelled to read the book, despite his burdensome opinions.  It gets repetitive, with every fortune teller saying almost the same things. There are times when he it seems like the so-called &ldquo;facts&rdquo; are just author&rsquo;s opinions.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/060960841X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=060960841X">This book</a> is written in the style of Ryszard Kapu&#x15B;ci&#x144;ski but it fails on so many levels.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<time datetime="2009-09-07T00:00:00+05:30" pubdate>Sep 7<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My activities as a web designer were becoming more prominent and my personal site did not express that sufficiently. Hence, I created <a href="http://nimbu.in">nimbu.in</a> (and I tweet about Web Design at <a href="http://twitter.com/nimbuin">http://twitter.com/nimbuin</a>).</p>


<p></p>

<p>While this site is, ahem, very colourful, it does not have a unique brand (other than the effusive colours). So, I set about creating a memorable but offbeat logo. I love the designs from the late 20s-30s and I found a perfect poster from my scrapbook to base my color scheme on (#1):</p>


<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3898682838_4de39ba0f0_o.png" alt="Inspirations for the design of nimbu.in" /> </p>


<p>I used the other two pictures to guide the aged and comics-like look of the logo. The text on the logo is customized from different serif fonts I found on early 20th century posters.</p>


<p></p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2615/3898656381_8bd6b8e72e_o.png" alt="Nimbupani Designs Logo" /><br/><small>The New Logo</small></p>


<p></p>

<p>Then, I wrote, and wrote, and wrote. I didn&rsquo;t realise writing about myself would be such a difficult task. After about 3 re-writes, I arrived at the current text.</p>


<p>Two days ago, I started creating the website. <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak Jois</a> was consistently prodding me to design for <a href="http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm">vertical rhythm</a> (he also asked me to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">widows</a> on the text, I refused &mdash; Web is not print).</p>


<p>This is my process to create a vertical rhythm in web pages:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Install and enable <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7943">Pixel Perfect</a> extension for Firefox Firebug.</li>                     
    <li><a href="http://netprotozo.com/grid/">Generate the grid</a> and download the grid as an image.</li>
    <li>Click on the Pixel Perfect tab on Firebug and overlay this image on the HTML page. You can position it exactly and also control the opacity.</li>
    <li>Once positioned, use <a href="http://getfirebug.com/css.html">firebug to manipulate the CSS</a> so that the text lines up vertically against the grid.</li>
</ul>


<p>
    This site is the beginning of the <a href="http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/">switch to HTML 5 </a>on my personal sites. 
</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might have noticed from <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/web-design.html">my previous writings on HTML 5 and CSS 3</a>, I typically write about topics I wish to know more about, after spending a few weeks intensely <span class="strike">googling</span> learning about them. These two weeks, they happen to be SVG and Canvas. The interwebs are heating up with debates about the merits of each, and many are predicting a deathmatch. However, my research convinces me that each has its own purpose, but definitely their time has come.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>What is SVG?</h3>


<p><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics and graphical applications in XML. Some examples of SVG are the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Wikipedia_svg_logo.svg">Wikipedia logo</a> and this &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; of SVG, <a href="http://www.amplesdk.com/examples/svg/tiger/">a Tiger</a>. View the source of those two SVG files to see how SVG looks like.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>What is Canvas?</h3>


<p></p>

<p>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-canvas-element">HTML 5 spec</a> defines it best: &ldquo;The canvas element represents a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly.&rdquo;</p>


<p><a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/xtech2006/">This presentation by Mozilla&rsquo;s Vladimir Vuki&#x107;evi&#x107;</a>, created in 2006, has a good explanation of the differences between SVG and Canvas, namely:</p>


<ul>
    <li>SVG is XML based. This means, every element is available within the SVG <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> (useful when you want to attach javascript event handlers for an element &mdash; say you want to make the SVG tiger&rsquo;s muskers twitch if you click on it). Canvas is not XML based.</li>                        
    <li>Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. SVG is a bunch of vectors and needs to be manipulated as a group of shapes. An analogy in the Photoshop world would be, creating a rectangle using the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; tool in vs. using paintbrush.</li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<h3>Who Will Win?</h3>


<p>Even though they are quite different in nature and purpose, there are several things that can be done using both Canvas and SVG. The recent popularity of the Canvas element seems to make some people sound the death knell for SVG. But, from what I have gathered, this is far from the truth.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Canvas is as good as an image — except it can be manipulated pixel by pixel. Right now, Canvas element cannot support event handlers (e.g. have a 20x20px wide rectangle within a canvas be clickable). SVG does.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Canvas, in its current state is not accessible. SVG however is <a href="http://www.iheni.com/just-how-accessible-is-svg/">quite accessible</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<p>All this might change, as there is a task force that is looking into a <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/canvas-api/canvas-2d-api.html">Canvas 2D API</a>. The very changes that might apply to Canvas might even get applied to the image element in future versions of SVG &mdash; which would a big win.</p>


<p>There are, however, <a href="http://www.borismus.com/canvas-vs-svg-performance/">significant performance differences between Canvas and SVG</a>. The outcome of the experiment described in the previous link is that, Canvas is more suitable for a graphics-intensive game where many objects are redrawn frequently (like this <a href="http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/04/super-mario-in-14kb-javascript.html">Super Mario game</a>), while SVG is best for applications that involve large rendering areas (like Google Maps).</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Can I use them now?</h3>


<p>Yes, you can. There are many initiatives to enable browsers which don&rsquo;t  support SVG or Canvas to render them using other means. Google has an impressive <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/">SVG Web</a> project that uses Flash to render SVG in browsers that do not support SVG natively. <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a> renders content into SVG or VML using javascript (it is NOT a javascript API for SVG or VML). For Canvas, Google has an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/">explorecanvas</a> library that uses VML (or Silverlight) to render Canvas elements (you simply need to include the excanvas.js file, and it should work) in Internet Explorer.  Do note that IE9 now supports both <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/info/ReleaseNotes/Default.html">SVG and Canvas</a>.</p>


<p>Mark Pilgrim, as usual, has written an excellent article on how to use <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html">Canvas</a> element, which is part of <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">his book on HTML 5</a>.</p>


<h3>So, really, who wins?</h3>


<p>Both. These are exciting times for SVG and Canvas. We finally have a native alternative to Flash for basic animation needs. Keep your eyes peeled on the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/">HTML mailing list</a> for breaking news. Or you can hear about them a few seconds later on my <a href="http://twitter.com/nimbuin">Web Development Twitter Stream</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last post, I described some <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/stalking-africa-online-part-1.html">African blogs to keep track of for stalking information about Africa</a>. Here are some of my favourite places online for listening to African news and music and a list of books I liked.</p>


<p></p>

<p>The best part of African culture is the music. I stumble upon some amazing bands through these podcasts:</p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.afropop.org/podcast/">Afropop Worldwide</a> has a good mix of West/South African music. But, I think it is too short and has less music and more commentary.</li>
    <li><a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/RF">Radio Freetown</a> plays choice hits of West Africa. They have not updated for the past 5 months, but the archives are well worth a listen.</li>
    <li>
<a href="http://ethnomusic.podomatic.com/ ">World Passport</a>, is mostly African music spiced with songs from other countries (mostly US). Pity they don&rsquo;t update it anymore. The archives are great! </li>            
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>These days though, I listen to songs on <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>.The songs stream quickly and are of good quality.</p>


<p>The only non-music podcast I listen to is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/africa/">BBC&rsquo;s Africa Today</a> has a round up of African news and tries to be unbiased. I  heard about <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/06/05/charles_taylor_converts_to_judaism">Charles Taylor’s conversion to Judaism</a> first here, before it made front pages elsewhere.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Books</h3>


<p>I have not read that many books about Africa, but I really liked the these:</p>


<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385425139?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385425139">The Famished Road</a> — Fascinating mix of legends with the story of a young boy growing up in poverty.</li>

They both present similar facets of Arabic Africa. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802170269?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802170269">The Translator</a> has a slightly different viewpoint — that of a Sudanese muslim woman who works as a translator. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400076560?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400076560">The In-Between World of Vikram Lall</a> is a very insightful look at Kenya from the time of the struggle for independence to current times — through the eyes of a Kenyan of Indian origin. </li>                          
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307385906?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307385906">What Is the What (Vintage)</a> is the story of <a href="http://www.valentinoachakdeng.org/">Valentino Achak Deng</a>, a child refugee from South Sudan. This is a heart wrenching book. I took days to recover from reading this story. </li> 
    <li>John Le Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316016764?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316016764">The Mission Song</a> is a gripping thriller based on fictitious events in Kivu (though it seems not far from the truth).</li>
</ul>


<p>The full list of books I have read about Africa is <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/nimbupani/books?category=read&tag=africa">here</a>.</p>


<p></p>

<p>That completes my African journey! Any podcasts or books you recommend? </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last two years, my secondary interest (apart from web design and illustrations) has been the African continent. I do not know where this interest came from. I suspect it must have been after reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No._1_Ladies'_Detective_Agency">No. 1 Ladies&rsquo;s Detective Agency series</a> by Alexander McCall Smith.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I am well aware that I am pandering to a stereotype by referring to this vastly diverse set of people as &ldquo;Africans&rdquo;. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067973869X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=067973869X">Africa: A Biography of the Continent</a> opened my eyes to the start contrasts  in African regions. But, I hope this list below gets beyond such stereotypes.</p>

<p>If you follow Fox news or the CNN you might think Africa is either a continent constantly at war or filled with naked poor people clicking their tongues (yes, I am exaggerating a bit — only a bit!). If you want to know better, you have to look elsewhere. Here are some of my sources of African news, music, culture that I have come to love.</p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://chrisblattman.com/">Chris Blattman’s blog</a>
    Chris Blattman talks a lot about Africa, aid, development, and conflicts. Very informative and entertaining for someone from the academia!</li>
    <li><a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/">Foreign Policy Blog</a>                     
    Foreign Policy has the most thorough coverage of World News daily (even better than the BBC), as far as I know.</li>
    <li><a href="http://worldbeats1.blogspot.com/">Seattle World Music Blog</a>
    I discovered <a href="http://www.magic-system.fr/">Magic System</a> through them. Enough said.</li>
    <li><a href="http://esteyonage.blogspot.com/">The Esteyonage</a> talks about daily life in Liberia. I really like these <a href="http://esteyonage.blogspot.com/search/label/gettin'%20by">posts on how people get by</a> despite 85% unemployment in Liberia. The sidebar has great links to other blogs on Africa.</li>
    <li><a href="http://delicious.com/BibliOdyssey/africa">BibliOdyssey</a> blogs about old artwork/papers that are in the online archives of libraries/websites from all corners of the world.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I regret to say, I spent most of my &ldquo;reading hours&rdquo; reading trivial Agatha Christies. I have no idea why I have such a fascination for her writing (even though it is racist, sexist, and what not). So, I have only 4 books to review here.</p>


<p></p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Death was the other woman</h3>
        <p>I picked this book randomly. I don&rsquo;t have much success with randomly picked books, but my intuition never stops me from doing so. Yes, this book was one of those miserable failures. But, on the bright side, it seems like I can finally discern how to tell a good story.</p>
        <p>Alarm bells rang when the author wrote this in her acknowledgements:</p>
        <blockquote><p>&ldquo;Most women consider themselves lucky to have a strong, sensitive, caring man in their lives. I&#x27;m more than lucky, I have three.&rdquo;               
        </p></blockquote>    
        <p>Yeah, it gets no better. Even though it is supposed to be a murder mystery set in the 50s. I would read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FErle-Stanley-Gardner%2FB000AQ3ZTC%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dntt%255Fathr%255Fdp%255Fpel%255F1&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Erle Stanley Gardner</a> any day compared to this one.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Famished Road</h3>
        <p>I typically don&rsquo;t read books that are sad or depressing. I really get involved and feel depressed all day. But, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385425139?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385425139">The Famished Road</a> was in my book list of books about Africa, so I had to read it. It is depressing, but oddly fascinating. There are a lot of Nigerian legends referenced. The book is about Azaro who is a spirit child determined to live with his parents instead of typically trying to return to the happy spirit world. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NYSF2YXH7XEF/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">This review on Amazon</a> has a great explanation of the legends of the Yoruba of Nigeria.</p>
        <p>One thing that grated was the repeated usage of &ldquo;urine&rdquo;, &ldquo;feces&rdquo;, &ldquo;sweat&rdquo;. It seems to be a pattern with all &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; novels &ndash; to describe as much of bodily fluids as possible. I do admit, it revolts me. But, I don&rsquo;t think it added anything to the story &ndash; maybe I am biased.</p>
    </li>                                                            
    <li>
        <h3>Do Travel Writers Go to Hell?</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307394654?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307394654">Do Travel Writers Go to Hell?: A Swashbuckling Tale of High Adventures, Questionable Ethics, and Professional Hedonism</a> is a book that was in the news for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7346101.stm">claiming Lonely Planet authors fabricate facts about places they vist</a>. After reading that book, you will never look at a Lonely Planet (or any other guide book) the same way again. The author&rsquo;s claims seem reasonable and common in all industries with freelancers (not just travel) &ndash; low fixed price project, no insurance, unreasonable deadlines. It is quite sad that Lonely Planet has evolved from a guidebook for those who &ldquo;rough it out&rdquo; to 5-star-loving-resort-hopping tourists. The author claims the budget travellers have shifted their royalties to Footprint publications.</p> 
        <p>It is a very well written book, almost reads like fiction!</p>
    </li>     
    <li>
        <h3>The Whuffie Factor</h3>
        <p>&ldquo;Whuffie&rdquo; is a word that appears in Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076530953X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=076530953X">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>, but, in this book, is almost equivalent to &ldquo;fluff&rdquo;. I first heard Tara Hunt speak at <a href="http://aneventapart.com">An Event Apart</a> and was dismayed. It was mostly a summary of this book and a plug for it. I decided to read this book before I criticized the contents of her talk.</p>
        <p>If you read techcrunch, twitter, and subscribe to feeds, this book is not for you &ndash; definitely was&rsquo;t for me! It reads like a &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who&rdquo; of the &ldquo;social media&rdquo; world (how I hate that word!) And about 100 pages of the book are dedicated to how she created communities for <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/TransitCampBayArea">Transit Camp Bay Area</a>, and Co&ndash;Working.</p>
        <p>More than these, I was horrified with how casually the book was written. I gulped as I read this &ndash; &ldquo;As one who has launched a company using the power of online communities&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; in her profile blurb on the book and sentences like &ldquo;&hellip;real cool factor of Moo cards is the self-design aspect the company gives you on its website.&rdquo; Thankfully, I had not bought this book. If I did, I would want my money back for sloppy writing!</p>
        <p>And frankly, I don’t think she has said anything new or innovative that has not been written about before – online. I would have been happier if this book was a blog.</p>   
        <p><em>Side Note:</em> Why were they trying to sell this book at Bar Camp Seattle? Obviously the attendees are the wrong audience for this book!</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>I feel bad for trashing a book. But I felt so annoyed after reading it! Any books you recommend?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>                        &lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/font-in-your-face.html" title="Font in your face | Nimbupani Designs"&gt;wrote about the great debate on @font-face&lt;/a&gt;, and was pleasantly surprised when Peter Bilak of &lt;a href="http://www.typotheque.com/"&gt;Typotheque&lt;/a&gt; invited me to beta-test their webfont service.&lt;/p&gt;     
                        &lt;p&gt;The primary advantages of Typotheque&amp;rsquo;s service is ease of use and faster load times (as compared to others). It only uses CSS (not javascript) to generate the font stack. By using font subsetting, the service generates smaller font files.&lt;/p&gt; 
                        &lt;h3&gt;How to Use Typotheque Webfonts&lt;/h3&gt;  
                        &lt;ul&gt;  
                            &lt;li&gt;Create an account with Typotheque.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Purchase fonts from a list of available webfonts.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Create a project on your account. Here you set which fonts you would like to use, the language you will use the font in, and domain it will be used in (you can set multiple domains).&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;The service generates a CSS file and gives you the link to it that you just need to add to between &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of your HTML page.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;You cannot access the CSS file by loading the url given above directly in your browser. Same is true for the font files as well.&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;If you are more street-savy, you might be able to download the font, but you can&amp;rsquo;t install it on your machine as it is not strictly a TrueType font.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Typotheque&amp;rsquo;s business model is to charge according to bandwidth usage (which seems fair). The exact prices are not available yet (nor are the EULAs for webfonts) and might just be the deciding factor in how successful this service becomes.&lt;/p&gt;   
                        &lt;p&gt;If you would like to know how the interface looks like, head over to &lt;a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/testing_typotheque_font-face_embedding/"&gt;Andy Clarke&amp;rsquo;s blog post on it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;h3&gt;Multi-Lingual Fonts with @font-face&lt;/h3&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Here is my &lt;a href="http://nimbupani.com/demo/typotheque/index.html"&gt;demo page with Typotheque font faces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have used their first Devanagri webfont &amp;ldquo;Fedra Sans Hindi&amp;rdquo;. It renders beautifully in browsers supporting @font-face on Windows. However, it is a different story on the mac. See the picture below:&lt;/p&gt;   
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/files/typotheque-multilingual-demo.png" alt="Typotheque Multilingual Demo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Apple uses their own proprietary &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/textfonts/ttrefman/RM06/Chap6AATIntro.html"&gt;Apple Advanced Typography&lt;/a&gt; (which is a set of extensions on top of True Type Font) for rendering complex ligatures which are found in Arabic or Devanagari scripts. There is a way to specify fonts such that you can provide the AAT format for Mac OS X and other kinds of fonts for the rest of the browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre>
@font-face {
    font-family: Lateef;
    src: url(../fonts/LateefRegAAT.ttf) format(&quot;truetype-aat&quot;), 
    url(../fonts/LateefRegOT.ttf) format(&quot;opentype&quot;);
}
</pre>


<p></p>

<pre><code>                        &lt;p&gt;Currently, in the CSS 3 draft, the following font formats can be specified &amp;ndash; True Type (supported by Opera, Safari, Firefox), OpenType (Opera, Safari, Firefox), Embedded OpenType (Internet Explorer), SVG Font (Safari &amp; &lt;a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/standards-support-in-opera-10-beta/#webfontssvg`"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I cannot confirm if Firefox supports it, IE definitely does not). &lt;/p&gt;       
                        &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Typotheque does not generate the AAT format font for their multi-lingual webfonts (you can see in my demo that the Hindi text is not rendered correctly, in all OS X browsers except Firefox, because of that). Firefox 3.5 on the Mac OS X, interestingly, does not use the font specified in the @font-face if it is not an AAT type of font. &lt;a href="#comment-2942"&gt;John Dagett explains it quite well in his comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;They have a point. Recently, Apple started &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType#Advanced_typography"&gt;supporting Open Type rendering for Arabic scripts&lt;/a&gt; (which means Typotheque&amp;rsquo;s Arabic webfont will be rendered correctly by all browser in Mac OS X 10.5). Typotheque feels that they would expand this to other scripts as well (like Devanagari) in the future. Updating their service to support yet another font format would require weeks of work.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;On the whole, I think this service has great potential and is a simpler alternative to &lt;a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2009/05/27/introducing-typekit/"&gt;Typekit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://kernest.com/"&gt;Kernest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you are a web designer going about your daily life, struggling with IE 6, huffing about CSS 3/HTML 5, berating your designers for not using web-safe fonts, and there comes a brick hurling towards you named @font-face. You are dumbstruck. You have no idea what hit you. Everyone is asking about it, and you pretend to know about it. Then you quickly google for it and are hit with even more bricks. I was one such web designer and I spent 4 days in agony, learning about @font-face. I wrote this down, so that no other web designer has to face this torture anymore. So here is the &ldquo;A to Z&rdquo; of what @font-face means now and what it will mean for the future of web design.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Digital/Computer Fonts</h3>


<p>Computer fonts are digital data files that are made up of a set of characters and glyphs to render text.</p>

<h3>Copyright issues with Computer Fonts</h3>


<p>The <a href="http://www.howdesign.com/article/fontpiracy/">U.S. Copyright Office has declared typeface design cannot be copyrighted.</a> (Some other countries do allow copyrighting of typeface designs). Hence, analog font designs (those metal characters) cannot be copyrighted.</p>




<p>However, all scalable digital fonts are treated as &ldquo;Computer Programs&rdquo; and hence come under the draconian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act" title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</a>. As they are treated as software, you only get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license">a license to use the software</a> following all the instructions of the font creator/seller. Almost all commercial licenses forbid you to share/link to fonts.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Font Embedding</h3>


<blockquote><p>Font embedding refers to technology that saves fonts (or subsets of fonts) inside document files. The aim of this is that recipients of the document can see it as it was designed, without having to have the fonts already installed on their computer.</p></blockquote>


<ul>
<li>Older version of <a href="http://fontlab.wikidev.net/Font_embedding">Electronic EULA Wiki</a></li>
</ul>


<p>There are two major font formats: True Type and Open Type. Both support, &ldquo;embedding protection&rdquo; by having an &ldquo;embed flag&rdquo; that specifies what kind of embedding permission has been allowed by the font seller. The permissions available are:</p>

<p><strong>Restricted License:</strong> This font cannot be modified or exchanged or embedded in any manner without first obtaining permission of the legal owner.</p>

<p><strong>Preview &amp; Print:</strong> This font may be embedded and temporarily loaded with a document on a remote computer. No editing of a document is allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Editable:</strong> This font may be embedded and temporarily loaded with a document on a remote computer, and the document may be edited and the changes saved.</p>

<p><strong>Installable:</strong> This font can be embedded and permanently loaded on a remote computer for use with the document. The user of the remote computer acquires the same rights and obligations as the original purchaser of the font.</p>

<ul>
<li>from <a href="http://www.fontembedding.com/document-font-embedding/">Document Font Embedding</a> <br/>
There has only been one case that has been brought to court which tested the usage of these embed flags. It was a case that Agfa Monotype brought against Adobe Systems for the software that Adobe produced which did not respect these embed flags. <a href="http://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-ten-years-under-dmca#footnoteref44_mk118s2">The court noted that embedding bits do not effectively control access to a protected work</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>@font-face</h3>


<p></p>

<p>Introduced in 1998 for CSS level 2, the first browser to implement it was IE 4 which used (and which IE 8 continues to use) a new format of font called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_OpenType" title="Embedded Open Type">EOT</a>. It was introduced (without the EOT) in the CSS 3 Draft &ndash; mostly thanks to <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">H&aring;kon Wium Lie</a>. Webkit (the web browser engine that powers Safari, Chrome) started supporting @font-face in October 2007, Firefox in October 2008, Opera 10 in December 2008. All of them do not recognize EOT format but only the existing popular True Type and Open Type formats.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>How to use it?</h3>


<p>It is quite simple. See the example below (from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-webfonts/#the-font-face-rule">CSS 3 draft</a>) for a simple use case:</p>


<pre>
    <code>
        @font-face {
          font-family: Gentium;
          src: url(http://site/fonts/Gentium.ttf);
        }

        p { font-family: Gentium, serif; }      
    </code>
</pre>


<p>Read Paul Irish&rsquo;s entry on <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/">how to use @font-face so that it works across all browsers that support it</a>. </p>


<p></p>

<h3>But there is no embed, you idiot!</h3>


<p></p>

<p>Technically, @font-face only <em>links</em> to fonts, but the browsers would have to download those fonts and store it in the user&#x27;s machine to render the HTML document. Hence, a lot of font developers treat @font-face font linking as font embedding.</p>




<h3>Drawbacks of @font-face</h3>


<p>Technically, you can use @font-face cross-browser <em>right now!</em> But there are a few issues with using @font-face:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Many fonts of today are really huge, running into 2MB or more. So, users of your website need to wait till the font downloads. In Firefox 3.5, the users will see the web safe font (if you have declared it) first before it switches to the downloaded font. But, scarily, in Safari, <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25207">you will see <em>nothing</em></a>, till the font loads (if it loads at all).</li>   
    <li>Firefox implements a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/index.php?title=En/CSS/%40font-face">same-domain restriction on fonts</a>, which means the font you use and the HTML file you use it on must be on the same domain name. You can overcome it by setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control">HTTP Access Controls</a> on the server where your fonts are stored.</li>
    <li>You can only use fonts which have been explicitly licensed for using with @font-face. You can find a those fonts in these sites: <a href="http://www.webfonts.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fonts_available_for_%40font-face_embedding#Fonts_which_specifically_allow_.40font-face_embedding">1</a>, <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">3</a>, <a href="http://blogof.francescomugnai.com/2009/07/20-beautiful-free-font-face-fonts/">4</a>.
        </li> 
        <li>A lot of designers think @font-face will herald the return of the 90s design and the &ldquo;downfall&rdquo; of web design as we know it. Obviously, this is a silly conjecture, tools do not make a design.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What is this EOT?</h3>


<p>Read this <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_OpenType">wikipedia entry on EOT</a> and come back here.</p>




<h3>Read it, why not just use EOT and be done with it?</h3>


<p>The main objections that Firefox and Safari have to using EOT is the clause in the specification of EOT that states &ldquo;If the font embedding bits do not provide permissions for embedding, the user agent shall not use the font.&rdquo; <p>A lot of <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/04/21/fuck-the-foundries">free software evangelists</a> are against the idea of using the embed flag as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</a></p></p>


<p>Another objection is that the compression technology used by EOT is patented by <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/">Monotype Imaging</a>. Monotype has claimed it will bring the <abbr title="MicroType Express">MTX</abbr> technology into public domain IF EOT gets adopted universally (a classic chicken-and-egg problem).</p>


<p></p>

<p>There is a proprietary Microsoft (windows-only) tool to generate EOTs, called <a href="">WEFT</a> and that tool does not convert Open Type fonts to EOT format, but the OTF fonts need to be converted first into True Type fonts (see <a href="http://jontangerine.com/log/2008/10/font-face-in-ie-making-web-fonts-work">Jon  Tan&rsquo;s great post on @ font-face</a>). However, there is an alternative, as pointed out by <a href="http://svzsolutions.nl/">Stefan van Zanden </a> called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/">ttf2eot</a> that does the same without the frustration of WEFT. <del>The last I checked, it seems like it does not output the root strings without which IE 7 and 8 cannot render EOT font</del>. Stefan has a <a href="http://svzsolutions.nl/samples/webfonts/index.html">demo</a> showcasing how the fonts work on most modern browsers.</p>


<p></p>

<p>EOT in it&rsquo;s current incarnation, needs a URL to be supplied with the original font and the resulting EOT font will only work on those specific websites.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Recently, some research suggests that <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009AprJun/0047.html">MTX compression has negligible effect on the file sizes of some ClearType fonts</a>, and some other compression algorithms like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel-Ziv-Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a> seem to work better.</p>


<p>More articulate arguments against EOT are in this excellent <a href="http://www.w3.org/Fonts/Misc/eot-report-2008">Report on Font Embedding</a></p>


<h3>So What Now?</h3>


<p>Many people have suggested entirely new web formats to implement. Some major proposals that have gained prominence:</p>


<ul>
    <li><p><strong>EOT Lite</strong> This does away with the two most hated parts of EOT, compression and respecting the embed flag. So, it ends up like a wrapper around the font itself (<a href="http://readableweb.com/jeffrey-zeldman-questions-the-eot-lite-web-font-format/">Read more about EOT Lite here</a>). The best part is, this will work with existing implementations of EOT in IEs. Not many type foundries are supporting this format though - mainly because of the removal of the recognition of the Embed Flag.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>webfont</strong> This has gained massive popularity recently. <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/0440.html">Webfont was first introduced here</a> and <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/0440.html">refined here</a> by <a href="http://www.letterror.com/">Erik Van Blokland</a> and <a href="http://talleming.com/2009/04/21/web-fonts/">Tal Leming</a>. A font of this format will contain two files compressed (proposed to use zip compression): </p>
        <p>1. info.xml<br/>
        2. Font file<br/></p> 
        <p>The xml will have info on the font meta data like: creator, create date, font name, vendor name, vendor url, etc. The most controversial of these is the &ldquo;allow&rdquo; field &mdash; which is the same as an Embed Flag &mdash; in that meta data which is stated as optional, and is proposed that browsers use this information as they wish (either show it in the Page Info area, or explicitly deny fonts from rendering if the Embed Flag prohibits such use).</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>ZOT</strong> has <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/0018.html">gained currency recently</a>. The proposal is for a compression format (by <a href="http://www.tug.org/interviews/interview-files/jonathan-kew.html">Jonathan Kew</a>) consists of a ZOTHeader, Tables Directory, and Font Tables. It allows a User Agent (e.g. a browser) to simply download the header and determine the number of tables required, and download only the necessary font tables (by looking up the Tables Directory) of the font to render the text.</p></li>    
    <li><strong>UPDATE on 7th Aug 2009:</strong> Jonathan Kew, Tal Leming, Erik Van Blokland have combined their proposals into <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/1238.html">a new WebOTF format</a> that seems to have the support of representatives of most browsers. Seems like this format might just win.</li>
</ul>


<h3>OK. What can I do NOW?</h3>


<p>You can use fonts from the <a href="http://openfontlibrary.org/wiki/Web_font_linking_with_%40font-face">Open Font Library</a>.</p>


<p>You can also use commercial fonts that are aligned with <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2009/07/21/serving-and-protecting-fonts-on-the-web/">Typekit</a>. Typekit uses javascript to provide some basic protection against downloading these fonts directly. Another service similar to Typekit is <a href="http://kernest.com/">Kernest</a>, some comments in the www-font mailing list seem to suggest it is not ready for prime-time yet. But, you have two options, if you would like to go the javascript route.</p>


<p>Typotheque Font Foundry has <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/news/web_font_service_preview">announced a web font service</a> which will provide both TTF and EOT fonts which are small and fast to load for a price. The service has not started yet. From the discussions on the www-font mailing list, it seems like <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/0684.html">Typotheque corrupts the NAME tables with referrer checking</a> which prevents the font from being installed on a computer. I am unable to confirm if this is true. If you have tested their service, do let me know in the comments if it is.</p>

<p>This current rage of Font Formats has been compared to the <a href="http://www.cloanto.com/users/mcb/19950127giflzw.html">GIF controversy of yore</a>. But, let&rsquo;s hope this too will lead to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">something great</a>.</p>


<p> <p>Hopefully, all this information has still left your brain intact to process other crazy information about font-face that will emerge in the coming days. Whatever it is, the ways and methods of a web designer are on the verge of radical change. Yes we can!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I vanished after that mid-month review of a record number of books I read in June. I think I have kept pace with the reading and I have 7 books to review for July! Sigh. I also managed to visit Cowboy Country of Montana and sample the Pacific Northwest. The highlight of this month was seeing bisons (for the first time) crossing my path less than 3 feet away! Here are short reviews of books I have read till now:</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Feet of Clay</h3>
        <p>Before I read the book, I was tempted to not review any more Terry Prachett books since I read them as obsessively as I read Agatha Christie or P G Wodehouse. But, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061057649?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061057649">Feet of Clay</a> was extraordinary. This is the best Discworld book I have read so far. The book is a murder mystery but has undercurrents of atheism and equality (gender/race/things) - all of which have been described with some of the cleverest usage of English I have read so far. Some gems &ldquo;If the atheist truly did not believe, they would not bother to deny.&rdquo;, &ldquo;&lsquo;Is he a man of property?&rsquo; &lsquo;Only other people&rsquo;s&rsquo;&rdquo;, &ldquo;Punctuality was the politeness of princes.&rdquo;, &ldquo;The razor moved calmly over the stubble of the night.&rdquo;</p>       
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Stories</h3>
        <p>I am usually not very enthusiastic about reading works by literary giants. So, I went for a risk-free trial of Doris Lessing, by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1841593168?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1841593168">Doris Lessing Stories</a>, an anthology of her short stories and novellas. Alas, I was not able to renew the book at the library, so dropped it half-way, but it was definitely an eye-opener. I didn&#x27;t understand some stories, but liked the writing. All the stories I read seem to have an undercurrent of melancholy which makes this book an ideal tropical Sunday afternoon read.</p>     
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Mission Song</h3>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t remember reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743457900?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743457900">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</a> (even though I have marked it as read in <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/nimbupani/books?category=read">my book list</a>), so I picked up John Le Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s recent work, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316016764?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316016764">The Mission Song: A Novel</a>, to refresh my memory of his writing. The book satisfies every aspect of a spy thriller and is an excellent display of how much John Le Carr&eacute; can get into a character&#x27;s skin. The ending is both predictable and some what unbelievable. But then, so is life!</p>       
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Art and Fear</h3>
        <p>If you have ever tried to draw before and gave up (like I did), then you should read this book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961454733?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0961454733">Art &amp; Fear: Observations On the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking</a>. The authors write about some of the most common fears of an artist and explain why we have those fears and how to confront them. Some interesting quotes &ldquo;We do not remember artists who followed rules diligently than anyone else. We remember those who made the art from which the rules inevitably follow.&rdquo; and &ldquo;In time exploration gives way to expression.&rdquo; What really impressed me was the emphasis of art as a medium for expansion and new ideas rather than as a quest for perfection. I am really enthusiastic about picking up the paintbrush now!</p>      
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>I, Robot</h3>
        <p>I am an Asimov fan after reading the <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/book-reviews-for-april-2009.html">Foundation</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/055338256X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=055338256X">I, Robot</a> is typical Asimov. I was really interested in the idea of a robot masquerading as a politician. Asimov had great insights about the future, but unfortunately, the stories are set in a &quot;future&quot; that is dated.</p>           
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Mad Travellers</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1853434558?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1853434558">Mad Travellers: Reflections on the Reality of Transient Mental Illnesses</a> was recommended reading for science fiction writers (lost the link, sorry!) It is a thoughtful analysis of the European craze in the late 19th century to diagnose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_state">Fugue</a>. The author describes some of the stereotypes and conditions of that era which contributed to European doctors diagnosing this illness more than their American counterparts. The case studies quoted are interesting and most often tragic.</p>
