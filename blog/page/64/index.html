  <div class="entry-content"><p>Agreed this topic is a bit stale. But it becomes fresher when <a href="http://www.adactio.com/journal/display.php/20031208220021.xml">creative ideas</a> start rolling out on how to beat piracy. While discussing this topic with <a href="http://vyom.oef">Deepak</a>, I came to know about this service called <a href="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/">Freenet</a>. If used to distribute songs and movies, what wonders it would do to the world of internet piracy! I am not sure how <A href="http://www.riaa.com/issues/piracy/default.asp">RIAA</a> is ever going to succeed in this campaign to stop piracy. There will always be smarter people with faster access to internet and with smarter ways to get round the law. Freenet is just one of these ways.</p>

<p>Now, I shall hope RIAA does not find this libelous enough to sue me! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All morons who maintain a hotmail account would have noticed the recent redesign. Perhaps you would also have struggled with the weird names and weird positioning of normal icons such as Sign Out, Inbox etc.</p>

<p><img alt="alt" src="/blog/images/hotmail-screenshot.png" /></p>

<p>Agreed, hotmail was in a desparate need of a redesign, but it definitely did not require this mismash. Starting with the stupid renaming of the <b>Inbox</b> as <b>Mail</b> and the <b>Compose</b> button as <b>New</b>. Yeah they are trying to make it look like MS Outlook. But they should remember that most hotmail users do not associate Outlook&#8217;s interface with hotmail or atleast should be warned so before we users try to stumble through with navigation. Else, they should have made hotmail look exactly like MS Outlook.</p>

<p>The worst thing is the positioning of the <b>Sign Out</b> button in the middle. Whatever on earth for! Every mail provider puts the <b>Log Off</b> or <b>Sign Out</b> button at the right most position or in the left bar. In the new hotmail, I had to search the whole page ( including the agonising ads on the right ) to find out where that darned button was. Before my eyes sighted the familiar <b>Sign Out</b> icon (atleast, they didnt change the icon).</p>

<p>I think there needs to be two different buttons <b>Compose</b> and <b>Add</b>. That will atleast stop confusing people and let them easily navigate through the site. Even better would be to provide for a <b>Find</b> bar rather than a <b>Find</b> button. The <b>Options</b> and <b>Help</b> links are located at some random corner which will only cause more headache. Agreed, those two links are the most least used. But people would like to use options to change their password. So an inclusion in the left bar seems logical. But I guess MSN designers are beyond any such logic.</p>

<p>Or perhaps its just my dumb brain thats complaining!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As an open source alternative for Photoshop, GIMP has left me speechless. There are many User-Unfriendly features, ( you can&#8217;t draw a simple rectangle, without some high tech hand wizardry). But, the <b>filters</b> and <b>script fu</b>s are awesome.
Here is how my poor flowers looked:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Hindu has produced a very thoughtful <a href="http://www.hindu.com/lr/2003/12/07/stories/2003120700100100.htm">extract</a> on <a href="http://www.vivekananda.org/biography.asp">Swami Vivekananda&#8217;s</a> revolutionary <a href="http://www.education-india.net/inspirationals/vivekanandwelcome.php">speech</a> at the World Congress of Religions. He considers Hinduism as the mother of all religions as it was the only religion to recognise other religions and also explains the moral codes and ethics that all religions tend to practice in philosophical terms.</p>

<p>But, the underlying message of the superiority of hinduism and heirarchy of religions has given enough ammunition to the &#8216;Hindutva&#8217; &#8220;leaders&#8221; to pull down several more mosques.</p>

<p><b>P.S:</b> The philosophical basis for Hinduism apparently follows what modern science has figured out. More in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570625190/qid=1070767621/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-9888278-4721531?v=glance&s=books">The Tao of Physics</a> .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A movie made for the only purpose of the upliftment of the morale of British citizens by showing  how &#8216;hot&#8217; American girls lust after even the ugliest of British boys and how the Prime Minister of Britain (Hugh Grant in a curiously Tony Blair look) , for once, does not act like the pet puppy of the U.S. It is quite a coincidence that even in the film the U.S President visits GB just like it happened <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3279179.stm">sometime back</a>.</p>

<p>The film has its moments. Its about love in all forms- brother love, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082314/">Ek-Duje-Ke-Liye</a>-but-happy-ending love, kiddo love, i-forgot-to-tell-you-i-love-you-before-you-got-married love, the yes-i-love-the-prime-minister love and i-once-loved-you love. Whew, and in the middle of all these affairs, we have Rowan Atkinson (for once, actually decently comical) as the perfect example of the English Gentleman and Bill Nighy (the villain in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320691/">Underworld</a> ) as Uncle Billy, the ageing pop star who makes a colourful comeback.</p>

<p>Well, its my money&#8217;s worth of fairytale. Its Christmas time anyways and I think this is one movie worth watching ( I am sure its gonna be better than the horrendous <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319343/">ELF</a>! ).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first introduction to <a href="http://www.doubtinghall.com/intro.html">Evelyn Waugh</a> was through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316926108/qid=1070351469/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-4917310-8726205?v=glance&s=books">Scoop</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my first year, I had several brushes with Christianity (I am a hindu). I mean, different types of the religion. Some student or the other from Protestant/Catholic/ others club would knock on my door, give me a fish ball ( I am a vegetarian) and would ask me personal details (which religion you follow? do you know about jesus christ? do you know about his wonders? would you want to become christian?). I hardly had time to say &#8220;no&#8221;, before which they would start requesting to &#8220;pray&#8221; for me. And, before I could refuse, they would already be deep in prayer.</p>

<p>I am not against Christianity. I am fine with people following whatever religion they want.  But I don&#8217;t like this pushy business of conversion especially in Universities. But <a href="http://www.harpers.org/JesusPlusNothing.html">this</a> article takes the cake:</p>

<p><I>&#8220;Regular prayer groups have met in the Pentagon and at the Department of Defense, and the Family has traditionally fostered strong ties with businessmen in the oil and aerospace industries&#8230;.In the process of introducing powerful men to Jesus, the Family has managed to effect a number of behind-the-scenes acts of diplomacy&#8230; The Brazilian dictator General Costa e Silva, with Family support, was overseeing regular fellowship groups for Latin American leaders, while, in Indonesia, General Suharto (whose tally of several hundred thousand ?Communists? killed marks him as one of the century&#8217;s most murderous dictators) was presiding over a group of fifty Indonesian legislators&#8221;</I></p>

<p>Lieutenant-General William G Boykin&#8217;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3199212.stm">speech</a> makes the article more credible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I am really really bored or too lazy, I try and analyse ants&#8217; behaviour (no kidding). I discovered that once I rub the path between two ants, the rest of the entourage are as lost as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/">Jack Sparrow</a> on the lonely island . I pondered on the possibility of performing surgery on an ant. I mean, like fix its leg or worse, mend its eyes. I  performed some of my own with the help of a safety pin on dead ants (killed painlessly with one stroke of my podgy thumb).</p>

<p>No doubt such noble intentions and explorations, if continued further, would contribute to the greater cause of preventing and curing ants of several diseases. <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000037">Here</a> is how I would have profitably used my experiences if I were a biologist.</p>

<p><b>P.S.</b> If you are still wondering why ants &#8220;lose sense of direction&#8221; read the article for more information. Its pheromones silly!</p>
