  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend was celebrated in the <a href="http://www.esplanade.com/apps/campaign/2005/Esp/Festivals/kalaa/">Kalaa Utsavam festival</a> at the Esplanade. There are an amazing variety of free performances which are worth paying for and watching.</p>

<p>The Saturday we looked at Prana and ogled at the amazing fusion of the Spanish guitar, sitar, tabla and the mridangam. The group even had their CDs on sale only for SGD 10 which I grabbed quickly. They were selling like hotcakes anyways!
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/62456200/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/33/62456200_a141d9fcca_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Prana Performance" /></a></p>

<p>The songs they played had parallels with pop songs as well as old bollywood songs. I realised that Stings &#8216;Fragile&#8217; and &#8216;Tum bin jaaon Kahan&#8217;from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230670/">Pyar Ka Mausam</a> are very similar, both of which are similar to a song Prana played.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we also got to see the amazing<a href="http://nimbupani.com/2005/11/11/manipur_in_singapore.php"> manipuri tribal dance and sword fight</a>. The dance was quite similar to bhangra without the usual bonhomie and exuberance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/62455360/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/26/62455360_a43e522844_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Manipuri Drummers" /></a></p>

<p>The Sunday was the <a href="http://www.esplanade.com/SOPApp/espsop/portal_proxy?uri=MS39VWeHTIx!OeoyFn,lhQtVzMxVdR3m6RplzQBHp-nPmlIWgYhkX,qa47sZM6oIB6qdE_sJFM">Eastern Rhapsody</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghatam">Vikku Vinayakaram</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/v_selvaganesh/html/frameset.htm">Selvaganesh</a>, <a href="http://www.mandolinshrinivas.org/">U. Srinivas</a>, <a href="http://www.taufiqqureshi.com/">Taufiq Qureshi</a>. Man, it was awesome! Vikku, Siva and Taufiq excited the audience to perform with them, which was an amazing confluence of rhythm. It was amazing to see the kind of effect a mass rhythmic expression has! Taufiq is very passionate about rhythm and explained to us how our daily life is infused with rhythm - the heart beats, the coughs (he is an amazing mimic as well!), the quarrels, the travel, etc.</p>

<p>Taufiq can also produce double sounds simultaneously! It was as if he was playing a set of drums with his mouth!</p>

<p>Chanced upon the whole Indian menagerie - <a href="http://sambharmafia.blogspot.com">Kaps</a>, friends from uni, and <a href="http://cerebralshangrila.blogspot.com">Cogito</a> (sorry for not recognising!). But surprisingly, the concert hall was not full. I wished they allowed us cheap ticket holders to move to the middle :(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taman_Negara">Taman Negara</a> is a protected area that has the oldest rainforests in the world. Whatever expectation you set for Taman Negara you wont be disappointed.</p>

<p><a href="http://mitokondrion.blogspot.com">Mito</a>, H, <a href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com">Deepak</a> and me went with mixed expectations. I had been warned that vegetarian food will be difficult to get and the advice on <i>curing</i> leech bites rather than <i>preventing</i> them still rung in my ears.</p>

<p>Anyways, instead of doing pages and pages of reporting on our stay in taman negara, here is a bullet point take away:</p>

<ul><li>Get a free and easy package trip from <a href="http://taman-negara.com">NKS Travels</a>.</li>

<li>If you are going from Singapore, better take the train to Jerantut - it is faster and more comfortable</li>

<li>If you do not like to return sweating buckets of sweat to a room which resembles a bat cave when there is no electricity, I suggest you book the room at the more expensive <a href="http://www.mutiarahotels.com/mutiara_tmnnegara/index.html">Mutiara Resort</a>. The rooms are beautiful and is at the entrance of the jungle. Any other &#8220;resort&#8221; or &#8220;village&#8221; is on the other side of the river, and to get to the otherside you need to pay 25 singapore cents each time. </li>

<li>If you are the adventurous or the unfortunate kind that takes a bus from KL followed by a three hour boat ride to Taman Negara, do prepare to get wet during the boat ride or to flex your muscles like jackie chan in the middle of the river. You will be asked to jump from one boat to the other or move seats within your boat.</li>

<li>Did I say it rains? I was saved by my expensive Esprit dry fit pants that dried instantly (though I didnt have this foresight before the three hour boat ride though).</li>

<li>There is no &#8220;path&#8221; in the jungle. The trails look trodden upon, but nothing more. If you have never trekked before, you might not know which trail to take, so go with a guide.</li>

<li>Dont expect to see animals or birds. The periphery of the forest is as bare as the Singapore&#8217;s fake ones. But if you plan to trek for more than two days, you might come across a few wild boars, though the forest even harbours elephants which are in the interiors.</li>

<li>Umbrella is still the best shelter from rain, always carry one.</li>

<li>Never forget mosquito repellent. Spray it as liberally as you can on your shoes, hands and every other exposed part of your body</li>

<li>The views from the hill tops are breathtaking. It is worth the breathless effort you have to put in, including jumping over fallen trees, prickly shrubs, weird shoots that seem to be made just to trip you</li>

<li>Best to go during summer, when it rains lesser and the paths are less slippery.</li>

<li>Dont miss Lata Berkoh. It is a set of cascades with strong currents. My cap sank without a trace there. I shudder to think about human beings drowning. But the way to Lata Berkoh is beautiful in its stillness and <i>jurassic park</i> like look (perhaps this is where the JP people got the idea from!).</li>

<li>Likewise, dont miss the Canopy walkway. It is really long and highly thrilling!</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_asli">Orang Aslis</a> look amazing. It is so amazing to see someone who has not adopted our &#8220;modern&#8221; ways of living. The malaysians are mighty proud of them!</li>

<li>The river around Taman Negara has drastic changes in currents, one second you are &#8220;shooting&#8221; rapids and the next you see the water as still as in Lake Placid.</li>

<li>The food is incredibly cheap across the river, and yes, you get tasty vegetarian food too.</li>

<li>If you apply enough mosquito repellents, leeches or any other living thing will not come anywhere near you. I never saw a leech, much to my regret.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;yet again! I am hurrying up to finish my first oil painting before I leave.</p>

<p>Need to fix my site too in time for <a href="http://cssreboot.com">CSS Reboot</a> - given that I scratched and shift deleted a design I had been working on in a moment of designer&#8217;s frustration. But I know a bulb will light some eerie corner of my brain by the end of this weekend :)</p>

<p>I also visited the Galerie Belvedere for an exhibition of Indonesian artists which were surprisingly too few a number. All of them seem quite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gauguin">Gauguin<i>ish</i></a>.</p>

<p>Oh did I tell you guys I am going away? <a href="http://taman-negara.com">Taman Negara</a> beckons! Canopywalk here I come!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didnt expect to see a film shooting today which is why I couldnt make a permanent imprint of the spectacle that was unfolding at <a href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/what_to_see/landmarks_and_memorials/lau_pa_sat.html">Lau Pa Sat</a> today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/54037095/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/54037095_ed26cb82c3.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="kriSHHHHHH!" /></a></p>

<p>As you may know, Singapore Tourism Board is &#8216;supporting&#8217; (I guess it must be financially and otherwise!) the bollywood film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432637/">&#8216;krrish&#8217;</a> which stars the young hunk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrithik_Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a> and the crew have been here for more than a month shooting at different locations.</p>

<p>The film is a sci-fi movie where apparently now the hero (Hrithik Roshan) gets super human powers (with Matrix-like costume!), consequently there are several stunts that were shot in Singapore. Today was the shooting of a flying scene from the Clock Tower of Lau Pa Sat to a nearby building.</p>

<p><a href="http://ultimatenigma.blogspot.com/">Ayekay</a> messaged one hour before I reached Lau Pa Sat that Hrithik Roshan was up there waiting to &#8216;fly&#8217; to the next building, and two hours later, Hrithik was still up there waiting. In a rainy day, with a heavy face mask (yay! the sci-fi hero wears a mask!) standing alone at the clock tower, for hours together,  waiting to be yanked by a crane to crash into some building next door with thousands of spectators watching with their mouth open does not seem like a good deal to me - even for 4 million dollars. Sigh, acting is a profession I will decline even if I am offered (get the hint <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakesh_Roshan">Rakesh</a>?).</p>

<p>But what struck me was the free rein given to the crew to shoot in Singapore with the actors dangling form ropes (precariously), leaping from tall towers, and antics that generally are not seen anywhere in Singapore! I wonder if such freedom will be given to film producers in Singapore to take a sci-fi movie based on a Singaporean super hero!</p>
